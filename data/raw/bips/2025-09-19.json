        {
          "user": "bitcoinguardian",
          "body": "@murchandamus \r\n\r\nThank you for the detailed technical review. You've identified legitimate limitations that I should address more explicitly in the BIP and refine. Let me respond to your specific concerns:\r\n\r\n**On Compromised Device Security**\r\n\r\nYou're correct that Guardian Address cannot protect against sophisticated attackers who can extract keys from memory or modify wallet software. However, this criticism applies equally to any software based security mechanism including password managers, hardware wallet interfaces, and even multisig coordinators running on compromised devices.\r\n\r\nGuardian Address doesn't claim to be a cryptographic guarantee. It's a coordination protocol that provides defence in depth for realistic threat scenarios:\r\n\r\nUser's phone is stolen while unlocked, but the user escapes and can signal from elsewhere using a pre-signed transaction\r\n\r\nEven if an attacker compromises a self-custody wallet, the same Guardian signal simultaneously freezes exchange accounts, triggers security team alerts, and locks other services\r\n\r\nMany services have withdrawal delays, 2FA verification, or identity checks that create windows where Guardian signalling is effective\r\n\r\nThe threat model is not \"attacker has root access to device and unlimited time\" - it's \"attacker has temporary access and must navigate multiple services with their own security layers.\"\r\n\r\nGuardians are another layer of defence.\r\n\r\n**On Scenario Plausibility**\r\n\r\nThe example scenario describes device theft, not sustained physical coercion. Realistic cases include:\r\n\r\n- Phone pickpocketed while unlocked at a cafe\r\n- Mugging where victim unlocks device under duress, then escapes\r\n- Border seizure of devices with active sessions\r\n- Remote compromise where \"unlocked\" means authenticated web sessions, not physical device control\r\n\r\nAdditionally, bitcoin services often have anti-theft delays: exchanges require email 2FA, impose withdrawal windows, or require video verification for large amounts. These create realistic timeframes where Guardian signalling provides protection even when the attacker has initial access.\r\n\r\n**On Cost**\r\n\r\nYou characterise the mechanism as \"expensive.\" A Guardian lock signal transaction costs under $1 at current fee rates (2.31 sat/vB as of today) or approximately $5 at the BIP recommended 20 sat/vB for reliable confirmation during higher network activity. For an emergency security mechanism that can coordinate lockdown across multiple services and protect potentially significant holdings, this is not expensive.\r\n\r\nTo put this in perspective, a typical bitcoin transaction costs the same or more as a Guardian signal. Users routinely pay higher fees for routine transactions and the cost is less than a cup of coffee for a mechanism that could protect thousands or millions of dollars in fiat terms.\r\n\r\nThe cost is actually a feature, not a bug. It prevents spam while remaining accessible for legitimate emergency use. Characterising sub $5 on-chain signalling as \"expensive\" would similarly apply to any bitcoin transaction based protocol.\r\n\r\n**On Mempool Propagation**\r\n\r\nYou're right that mempool propagation is best effort.\r\n\r\nHowever wallets already monitor mempools for incoming payments, RBF detection, and fee estimation. This isn't introducing new requirements.\r\n\r\nFinality provides signal confirmation, while mempool visibility enables rapid response (often critical in emergency scenarios), the protocol requires honouring confirmed signals, making the security guarantee time bounded rather than absent.\r\n\r\nMultiple broadcast paths mitigate propagation issues. Users can broadcast through multiple RPC nodes or services simultaneously. If you check out the [PoC signal tooling this is the example behaviour.](https://github.com/bitcoinguardian/GASPv1-draft/blob/main/guardian_signal.py#L220) Requiring confirmation means 10+ minute delays that may reduce the emergency response effectiveness.\r\n\r\nThe question isn't \"is this perfect?\" but \"is this better than having no emergency signalling mechanism?\" I believe imperfect propagation with 30 second to 10 minute response time is substantially better than the status quo of no signals. Guardian signals were detected and applied within seconds in my [Electrum fork and testnet3 implementation](https://github.com/bitcoinguardian/electrum).\r\n\r\n**On Airgap Compatibility**\r\n\r\nYou note that the proposal is \"likely incompatible with basic security practices like airgap setups.\" This limitation is already documented in the BIP section \"Threat Model and Limitations\":\r\n\r\n\"Guardian Addresses will not protect wallets that are airgapped or otherwise unable to query address state from the latest block height.\"\r\n\r\nThis is an acknowledged tradeoff. The protocol serves the majority of Bitcoin users who operate hot wallets, mobile wallets, or desktop wallets with Internet connectivity. For users who prioritise airgap security above emergency coordination capabilities, Guardian Address is not the appropriate tool and the BIP states this explicitly.\r\n\r\n**On Comparison with Multisig**\r\n\r\nMultisig and Guardian Address solve orthogonal problems:\r\n\r\n- **Multisig provides**: Distributed authorisation for spending (requires multiple parties to approve)\r\n- **Guardian Address provides**: Emergency lockdown coordination (one party can freeze across services)\r\n\r\nKey differences:\r\n\r\n| Capability | Multisig | Guardian Address |\r\n|------------|----------|------------------|\r\n| Retrofit existing wallets | No | Yes |\r\n| Emergency lockdown without all signers | No | Yes |\r\n| Coordinate across custodial services | No | Yes |\r\n| Prevent spending when attacker has M-of-N devices | No | Yes (if signal sent first) |\r\n| Cryptographic spending constraints | Yes | No |\r\n\r\nA sophisticated user should use both; multisig for spending authorisation, Guardian Address for emergency coordination. They're complementary, not competing.\r\n\r\nThe value proposition that no other BIP addresses is cross-service emergency coordination via a single on-chain signal that can simultaneously:\r\n\r\n- Lock self-custody wallets\r\n- Freeze exchange/custodial accounts\r\n- Alert security monitoring services\r\n- Trigger incident response procedures\r\n- Notify emergency contacts or insurance providers\r\n\r\n**On Physical Security Response Coordination**\r\n\r\nBeyond digital wallet locks Guardian Address enables a broader security response dimension that no other bitcoin protocol provides:\r\n\r\n**Deterrence through uncertainty:** An attacker who gains device access faces fundamental uncertainty - they don't know if a Guardian lock has already been broadcast, how many services monitor it, what physical security response may be underway, or whether law enforcement has been alerted. This uncertainty itself has protective value, potentially causing attackers to abandon attempts rather than risk detection and apprehension. This significantly changes game theory outcomes by adjusting the risk/reward balance to favour the defender.\r\n\r\n**Immediate stakeholder notification:** Security monitoring services, family members, business partners, or legal counsel can monitor the Guardian Address and receive instant alerts when a lock signal appears on-chain, enabling coordinated response before an attacker can complete theft.\r\n\r\n**Law enforcement coordination:** Guardian signals provide timestamped, cryptographically verifiable evidence of theft attempts. A broadcast lock signal creates an immutable blockchain record that the wallet owner has declared their holdings under threat, which can be critical for investigations and prosecutions.\r\n\r\n**Insurance claim substantiation:** For users with custody insurance or institutional policies, Guardian signals provide irrefutable proof of when control of assets was lost, simplifying claims and establishing clear timelines that satisfy insurers' evidentiary requirements.\r\n\r\n**Time buying for physical intervention:** Even a 10 minute delay from digital Guardian locks allows critical time for contacting authorities, alerting building security, reaching physical safety, or coordinating with security teams. The Guardian signal serves as a self-sovereign \"panic button\" that buys time when every second matters.\r\n\r\nThis physical-digital coordination capability is unique to Guardian Addresses. Multisig requires coordinating multiple parties to act (slow and requires consensus), while timelocks operate on fixed schedules (inflexible and can't respond to emergencies). Guardian provides near instant, unilateral emergency coordination across both digital services and physical security response, which is a capability gap that no existing bitcoin protocol addresses.\r\n\r\n**On \"Not Technically Sound\"**\r\n\r\nI respectfully disagree with this characterisation. The technical criticisms you've raised are:\r\n\r\nExpensive - At under $1 (current rates) to $5 (recommended rate), this is trivial for an emergency mechanism protecting significant holdings.\r\n\r\nBest effort mempool propagation - Acknowledged. This is a tradeoff for rapid response. Imperfect ≠ unsound.\r\n\r\nAirgap incompatibility - Already documented in the Threat Model section. The protocol serves connected wallets (the majority use case).\r\n\r\nAttacker can modify software - This applies to any software security and doesn't make the protocol unsound.\r\n\r\nThe protocol is technically sound in that:\r\n\r\n- The ABNF grammar is formally specified\r\n- The state machine is defined with clear semantics\r\n- The blockchain interaction is straightforward. Working implementation exists (Electrum fork with testnet demo)\r\n- The signalling mechanism is cryptographically verifiable\r\n\r\nWhether the security benefit justifies adoption is debatable, but the technical specification itself is sound.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Revisions**\r\n\r\nBased on your feedback, I'll revise the BIP to:\r\n\r\nLead with threat model clarity. Explicitly state upfront what attacks this does and doesn't protect against\r\n\r\nEmphasise cross-service coordination rather than device compromise protection as the primary benefit.\r\n\r\nStrengthen abstract/motivation: I submitted this proposal to the bitcoin-dev mailing list with a comprehensive abstract/motivation with more detail, but made more generic in the BIP.\r\n\r\nAdd comparison table to show how Guardian Address complements (not replaces) multisig, timelocks, and vaults.\r\n\r\nWhile airgap incompatibility is documented, I'll make this more prominent by improving limitations visibility. \r\n\r\n**Request for Specific Guidance**\r\n\r\nTo move this forward:\r\n\r\n- If the concern is primarily about overstated claims, would you find the proposal acceptable with more conservative framing and explicit threat model boundaries?\r\n- Are there specific technical changes to the protocol itself that would address your concerns, or is this primarily about positioning/motivation?\r\n\r\nI believe there's genuine value in standardising an emergency coordination mechanism that works across both self-custody and custodial environments. I'm committed to revising the BIP to address legitimate concerns while preserving that core utility.\r\n\r\nApologies for the formatting issues, this is my first BIP and I'll get this resolved!",
