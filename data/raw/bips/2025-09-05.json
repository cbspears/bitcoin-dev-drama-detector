      "body": "- Replace raw Base58 decode and manual slice with base58.decode_check(xpub) to enforce checksum validation as required by BIP-32 and as implied by the method docstring.\r\n- Add strict len(data) == 78 check before parsing to ensure the serialized extended key length matches the BIP-32 78-byte structure.\r\n- This prevents accepting corrupted or truncated extended keys and aligns deserialization behavior with Base58Check semantics.",
