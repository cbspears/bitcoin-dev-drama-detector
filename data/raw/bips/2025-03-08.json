          "body": "As I read it, this proposal is either a client-side validation scheme or requires a consensus change (or both), while claiming to be neither. The latter contradiction makes the comparison with existing schemes seem skewed. Especially, it is not at all obvious why this n-th standard for tokens is supposed to obsolete all others.\r\n\r\nThis proposal should be improved to clarify what it is trying to achieve and how it is achieving that. There seems to be an underlying misunderstanding either about how consensus works or what mechanisms are necessary to achieve enforcement and validation as described in this document.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if future responses to questions were more to the point. The prior responses mostly repeat claims from the proposal, but barely address the main gist of my questions. Just because other networks have allowed themselves to be fully cannibalized by tokenization and the ensuing speculation and gambling, it is by no means obvious to me how tokens improve Bitcoin.",

          "body": "Thank you for your thoughtful feedback. I appreciate your concerns and will address them directly:\r\n\r\nRegarding enforcement without consensus changes:\r\nTBS uses standard Bitcoin Script to enforce token rules. Token supply is maintained through transaction structure - when tokens are transferred, the transaction must spend existing token UTXOs and create outputs with identical token commitments where input and output amounts match exactly. This conservation is enforced through Bitcoin's existing UTXO model and script validation.\r\n\r\nOn the apparent contradiction:\r\nYou're right that TBS requires compatible wallet software to create valid token transactions (similar to multisig). However, unlike pure client-side validation, the token rules are enforced directly through Bitcoin's consensus mechanisms when validating scripts - any node can verify token transactions without external systems.\r\nOn comparison with other standards:\r\n\r\nI don't claim TBS would necessarily obsolete all others - different approaches have different tradeoffs. The goal is to offer a standard that minimizes blockchain bloat and aligns with Bitcoin's security model.\r\nOn improving Bitcoin:\r\n\r\nI understand your concern about tokenization's effects on other networks. My observation is simply that token activity is already happening on Bitcoin, and a well-designed standard might help reduce negative externalities like excessive data storage.\r\nI've edited my previous replies to be more direct and on-point. I apologize for my lengthy earlier responses. I'm fairly new to this process and would genuinely appreciate your guidance on how to improve this proposal.\r\n\r\n If you have any further questions, I would be happy to answer them.",

          "body": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nFirst, I just want to say thank you very much to everyone who took the time to review, ask questions, and challenge the original version of my proposal. I truly appreciate all the advice and critical feedback. It helped me realize many important points I had overlooked, and it gave me the opportunity to dive deeper, refine my thinking, and improve both the technical design and my understanding of Bitcoin’s principles.\r\n\r\nI’m sincerely grateful for the patience, the detailed technical explanations, and for pushing me to think more clearly.\r\n\r\nI would especially like to thank @murchandamus — your detailed feedback, questions, and explanations helped me significantly improve the proposal.\r\nI truly appreciate the time and effort you put into providing such thorough and technical feedback.\r\n\r\nI’d like to respond point-by-point to the key concerns raised previously:\r\n\r\n1. Enforcement vs Client-side Validation:\r\nI now fully recognize that my earlier PBTS (now renamed TSB-P) proposal incorrectly implied that token conservation could be enforced on-chain without consensus changes. That was a misunderstanding on my part.\r\nThe updated TSB-P is explicitly a wallet recognition standard only — similar to BIP39 (seed phrases) or BIP21 (payment URIs).\r\nNo claims are made about token enforcement by Bitcoin nodes; it is purely a voluntary pattern recognized at the wallet level.\r\n\r\n2. Use of OP_CAT and Transaction Introspection:\r\nI now understand that OP_CAT is not available in Bitcoin Script today, and that transaction introspection is not possible without a consensus change like covenants.\r\nThe updated TSB-P proposal completely avoids OP_CAT, introspection, or any claims of enforcing token conservation. It simply standardizes a Taproot leaf script format for wallet display purposes.\r\n\r\n3. Mailing List Submission:\r\nI realize now that I should have posted the early draft to the bitcoin-dev mailing list first. I would like to kindly ask:\r\n👉 Would it be appropriate for me to now post the updated TSB-P draft there for community feedback before submitting an updated PR here?\r\nIf yes, I would be very happy to do so and follow any recommended guidelines or suggestions you have.\r\n\r\n4. Scope Clarification:\r\nBased on your feedback, I’ve made sure that the new TSB-P proposal does not claim to \"improve Bitcoin\" at the protocol level. It aims to improve wallet interoperability only — no consensus changes, no protocol modifications, no on-chain token rules — simply a way for wallets to recognize token-like scripts if they choose to.\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\nI have already updated the PR branch with the new TSB-P version based on the feedback.\r\n\r\nI am still actively working on refinements and would love to continue improving it with more input.\r\n\r\nI truly welcome any further comments, critiques, or suggestions to help make this proposal stronger and more aligned with Bitcoin’s philosophy.\r\n\r\nOnce again, I am very thankful for the opportunity to learn from this process, and I deeply appreciate the time and energy the reviewers have invested.\r\n\r\nI look forward to continuing to improve based on your guidance and hope to eventually contribute something valuable back to the Bitcoin ecosystem.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you'd prefer me to proceed — I’m ready to post to the mailing list if that would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThank you again! 🙏\r\n\r\n— Gobi Shanthan",

It introduces structured programmability without requiring changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules.\r\n\r\n### Key Highlights:\r\n\r\n- **Layer 1 Implementation:** Tokens are fully validated and transferred on Bitcoin's base layer without external dependencies.\r\n- **Taproot Optimized:** Minimal impact on scalability, with optimized transaction size and fees.\r\n- **Structured Programmability:** Enables predefined execution paths, such as vesting contracts, milestone-based escrows, and oracle integration.\r\n\r\nFull details are available in the proposed BIP markdown file:  \r\n- [bip-pbts.md](bip-pbts.md)\r\n\r\nFeedback, suggestions, and discussion are welcome.\r\n",
