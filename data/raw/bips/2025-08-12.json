          "body": "Hi @jonatack,\r\n\r\nThank you for your questions! Below are the explanations for the changes:  \r\n\r\n### **1. Why Reorder the List?**  \r\nThe new ordering follows a more logical and practical structure:  \r\n- **MIT-0 and MIT licenses first**: Bitcoin Core predominantly uses MIT-style licenses, so listing them first improves readability for contributors.  \r\n- **CC licenses grouped together**: CC0-1.0 (public domain dedication) and CC-BY-4.0 (attribution) now appear sequentially for clarity.  \r\n- **BSD and other permissive licenses follow**: Ordered by common usage in Bitcoin-related projects.  \r\n\r\n**Improvements:**  \r\n✅ Prioritizes licenses most relevant to Bitcoin Core (MIT variants).  \r\n✅ Groups similar licenses (CC, BSD) for easier reference.  \r\n✅ Reflects real-world usage patterns in the ecosystem.  \r\n\r\n### **2. Why Add MIT-0?**  \r\nMIT-0 (**MIT No Attribution**) is a valuable addition because:  \r\n- **No-attribution requirement**: Unlike standard MIT, it removes the obligation to include copyright notices in binaries/distributions.  \r\n- **Simplifies compliance**: Useful for small dependencies where attribution would be impractical.\r\n\r\n**Difference from CC0-1.0:**  \r\n| License      | Patent Clause? | Warranty Disclaimer? | Attribution Required? |  \r\n|--------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|  \r\n| **MIT-0**    | No             | Yes                  | ❌ No                 |  \r\n| **CC0-1.0**  | No             | Yes                  | ❌ No (public domain) |  \r\n\r\nWhile both waive attribution, CC0-1.0 dedicates works to the *public domain*, whereas MIT-0 retains copyright but waives attribution.  \r\n\r\n### **3. Redirecting URLs**  \r\nAll URLs were checked for 301/302 redirects (e.g., opensource.org links previously redirected to newer versions). Fixed links now point to canonical, stable URLs.  \r\n\r\n### **Summary of Changes**  \r\n1. **Ordering**: MIT-family → CC → BSD/others (aligned with Bitcoin Core's preferences).  \r\n2. **Added MIT-0**: For modern, attribution-free use cases.  \r\n3. **Fixed URLs**: Eliminated redirects for long-term reliability.
