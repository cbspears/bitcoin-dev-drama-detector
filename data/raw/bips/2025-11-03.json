      "body": "Context: bip-0328/reference.py imported xpub_to_pub_hex, but the symbol is never used; this triggers lint warnings and adds noise to reviews. Change: Drop the unused _base58.xpub_to_pub_hex import so the module only depends on what it actually uses. Testing: python bip-0328/reference.py (blocked locally: Python runtime not available in the environment, behavior unaffected by import cleanup)",
