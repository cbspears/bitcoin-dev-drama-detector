      "title": "BIP Draft: Optimal Batch Proofs for Utreexo",
      "body": "This draft proposes a deterministic, canonical, and bandwidth-optimal batch proof format for Utreexo accumulator forests.\r\n\r\nThe proposal defines a canonical ordering of proof elements and a bitmap-guided verification stream that eliminates redundant hashes while preserving full verifiability and non-malleability.\r\n\r\nThe specification includes normative pseudocode, explicit failure modes, and reference test vectors. A Python reference implementation was used to validate all vectors.\r\n\r\nThis proposal does not modify consensus rules and is intended for use by wallets, light clients, and Utreexo-based systems.\r\n\r\nFeedback is welcome, particularly regarding serialization choices and deployment considerations.\r\n",
