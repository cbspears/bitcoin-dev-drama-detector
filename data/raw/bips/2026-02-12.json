      "title": "bip-tap: BIPs for the Taproot Assets Protocol",
      "body": "## Overview\r\nThese BIPs describe the Taproot Asset Protocol, a Taproot-native asset\r\noverlay built on top of the base Bitcoin blockchain. Taproot Assets enable\r\nthe representation of arbitrary (normal and collectibles) assets on top of\r\nBitcoin without bloating the base chain. The protocol is designed such that\r\ntransactions interacting with Taproot Assets are indistinguishable from\r\nregular transactions from the PoV of the Bitcoin blockchain. Taproot Assets\r\nextend the base Taproot script tree with a nested ''asset script'' tree (a\r\nmerkle-sum sparse merkle tree, or MS-SMT) that commits to valid witnesses as\r\nstructured metadata that allow for proofs of the movement of assets across\r\nthe transaction graph.  The provenance of transfers of a Taproot Asset can\r\nbe verified using a hermetic proof transmitted as flat file, or using the\r\naide of an externally maintained Universe, which is a MS-SMT that indexes\r\non-chain asset issuance+transfers, which natively supports\r\nproof-of-reserves/supply system.\r\n\r\nTaproot Assets support off-chain single and multi-hop transfers over\r\nLightning channels (based on the BOLT protocol suite), with the latter\r\nmanifested using Taproot Assets' unique embedded asset script system.  Light\r\nclient verification of on-chain Taproot Asset transfers is facilitated by a\r\nseries of on and off-chain merkle proofs, which can be compressed by\r\ndelegating a trust relationship to an active Universe instance. A variant on\r\noff-chain multi-party channels are proposed to support off-chain transfer of\r\nnormal assets.  In addition, a special type of Universe, dubbed a Pocket\r\nUniverse, which is based on an exit-only commit-chain design can be used to\r\naggregate transfers on-chain in a trust-minimized manner.\r\n\r\n## BIP Documents \r\n\r\nWith this PR, we seek to request BIP numbers be assigned for the 7 included documents:\r\n  * `bip-tap-mssmt`: describes the MS-SMT (Merkle-Sum Sparse Merkle Tree) data structure used to store assets and various proofs. \r\n  * `bip-tap`: describes the Taproot Assets Protocol validation and state transition rules. \r\n  * `bip-tap-addr`: describes the address format used to send and receive assets. \r\n  * `bip-tap-vm`: describes the initial version of the off-chain TAP VM used to lock and unlock assets. \r\n  * `bip-tap-vpsbt`: describes a vPSBT (virtual PSBT) which is a series custom types on top of the existing PSBT protocol to facilitate more elaborate asset related transactions. \r\n  * `bip-tap-proof-file`: describes the flat file format which is used to prove and verify the provenance of an asset \r\n  * `bip-tap-universe`: describes the Universe server construct, which is an off-chain index into TAP data on-chain, used for: proof distribution, asset boostraping, and asset transaction archiving. \r\n\r\nFor each BIP, we also include a sub-directory that includes comprehensive test vectors (to be expanded over time).

Constructing such transactions is tricky, especially given the dust limit and doing proper fee estimation, but once you get the details right it works well, and the fact that such transactions are otherwise normal Bitcoin transactions means that existing bitcoin infrastructure can be leveraged.\r\n\r\nSince we've been using ordinal numbers in production and getting some users of the software it seemed appropriate to request a BIP number.\r\n\r\nI've never applied for a BIP number before, so definitely let me know if anything should be changed or can be improved!",

The proposal aims to address the potential vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing while preserving backward compatibility with existing Bitcoin infrastructure.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nAbstract: QES2 leverages a dual-signature mechanism to incorporate both a post-quantum signature and a classical ECDSA signature into Bitcoin transactions.\r\n\r\nMotivation: With the emerging threat of quantum computers, classical cryptographic methods may become vulnerable. QES2 presents a transitional solution that enhances security during the shift towards quantum-safe systems.\r\n\r\nSpecification: The BIP outlines the structure, key generation, signing, and verification methods for the hybrid scheme.\r\n\r\nRationale: The hybrid approach ensures that if one signature method is compromised, the other still provides protection, offering a balanced trade-off between security and backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nReference Implementation: A reference implementation will be linked later for further review and testing.",

This has caused many links around the web to become broken.\r\n\r\n# Redirect web service\r\n\r\n[gnusha.org/url](https://gnusha.org/url) is a web service that redirects old style archive urls to a new location where the content can be viewed.\r\n\r\nFor example, a bitcoin-dev mailing list archive url like:\r\n\r\n`https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-June/014472.html`\r\n\r\nusing `https://gnusha.org/url/https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-June/014472.html`\r\n\r\nis redirected to:\r\n\r\n`https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/ogoa6o$o4s$1@blaine.gmane.org/`\r\n\r\nThe redirect mappings were generated from my archives and you can review the scripts I made to do that here:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/kanzure/4e7bcc58344ceaa1a668e65a434adb2b\r\n\r\n# Alternative\r\n\r\nInstead of using `gnusha.org/url`, another option would be to resolve all of the archive urls to their email `Message-ID` redirects for the bitcoin-dev mailing list and use those urls instead. In fact, either [gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev) or https://mailing-list.bitcoindevs.xyz/bitcoindev/ could be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThose links would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CABaSBaxDjj6ySBx4v+rmpfrw4pE9b=JZJPzPQj_ZUiBg1HGFyA@mail.gmail.com/\r\nhttps://mailing-list.bitcoindevs.xyz/bitcoindev/CABaSBaxDjj6ySBx4v+rmpfrw4pE9b=JZJPzPQj_ZUiBg1HGFyA@mail.gmail.com/\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this is the preferred solution for the BIPs, then let me know how I can help. Take a look [here](https://gist.github.com/kanzure/4e7bcc58344ceaa1a668e65a434adb2b).\r\n\r\nFinally, one other alternative is to wait and do nothing. Maybe someone can convince Linux Foundation to put up the static HTML archives for posterity?\r\n\r\n# More background\r\n\r\nFor more information see:\r\n\r\n* https://gnusha.org/url\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29782#issuecomment-2460974096\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31240\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoinops/bitcoinops.github.io/pull/2018\r\n* https://github.com/bitcointranscripts/bitcointranscripts/pull/566\r\n* https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CABaSBaxDjj6ySBx4v+rmpfrw4pE9b=JZJPzPQj_ZUiBg1HGFyA@mail.gmail.com/\r\n* https://x.com/kanzure/status/1853779672514826334\r\n\r\n",

      "title": "BIP445: FROST Signing Protocol for BIP340 Signatures",
      "body": "This PR adds a BIP for the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signing protocol. The development repository is at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing.\r\n\r\nThere already exists [RFC 9591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9591.html), which standardizes the two-round FROST signing protocol, but it is incompatible with Bitcoin's BIP340 X-only public keys. This BIP bridges that gap by providing a BIP340-compatible variant of FROST.\r\n\r\nThis BIP standardizes the FROST3 variant (Section 2.3 of the [ROAST paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550.pdf)). This variant shares significant similarities with the MuSig2 signing protocol (BIP327). Accordingly, this BIP follows the core design principles of [BIP327](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki), and many sections have been directly adapted from it.\r\n\r\nFROST key generation is out of scope for this BIP. There are sister BIPs such as [ChillDKG](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg) and [Trusted Dealer Generation](https://github.com/BEULAHEVANJALIN/bip-frost-trusted-dealer) that specify key generation mechanisms. This BIP must be used in conjunction with either of those for the full workflow from key generation to signature creation. Careful consideration has been taken to ensure the terminology in this BIP matches that of ChillDKG.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple (experimental) implementations of this specification:\r\n- The reference Python implementation included in this PR\r\n- [secp256k1-zkp FROST module](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/pull/278) (yet to implement the test vectors)\r\n- ~[FROST-BIP340](https://github.com/jesseposner/FROST-BIP340)~ TODO: verify if this impl is compatible with our test vectors\r\n- ~[secp256kfun](https://github.com/LLFourn/secp256kfun/blob/master/schnorr_fun/src/frost/session.rs) (implements ChillDKG with FROST signing)~ TODO: verify if this impl is compatible with our test vectors\r\n\r\n**Disclosure:** AI has been used to rephrase paragraphs for clarity, refactor certain sections of the reference code, and review pull requests made to the development repository. \r\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated! Please comment on this pull request or open an issue at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing for any feedback. Thank you!\r\n\r\ncc @jonasnick @real-or-random @jesseposner",

This makes the document more like BIP-0173: proposing an encoding \"codex32\", then defining a standard for something using it.\r\n\r\nSee discussion on https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2023#issuecomment-3538570493.\r\n\r\n**Spec:**\r\n- fixed the threshold mistake in the abstract\r\n- replaced \"master seed\" with \"secret\", prior to the \"Master seed format\" section and made descriptions hrp general\r\n- updated the checksum reference code to produce valid checksums for any `hrp`\r\n- change _t_ to _k_ to match the test vectors and book\r\n- defined \"ms\" codex32 secrets:\r\n  - using terms \"secret seed\" (as the book does) and \"codex32-encoded master seed\" to refer to \"ms\" codex32 secrets\r\n  - recommended using first 4 characters of the bech32-encoded fingerprint as the identifier\r\n  - recommended the padding bits be set with a CRC code for extra error detection. Provided reference code for this checksum.\r\n\r\n**Test Vectors:**\r\n\r\n- Fixed the cornucopia of naming conventions in the Test vectors \r\n  - used mostly \"secret seed\", \"codex32 secret\", and \"codex32-encoded X\".\r\n- Fixed test vector 5 which did not actually append a long checksum to \"random\" data as the text said it would.\r\n- Added vector 6 encoding a \"cl\" prefix codex32-encoded HSM secret, then relabels the identifier (producing a new checksum and codex32-encoded HSM secret)\r\n- Added vector 7 which parses a \"cl\" prefix codex32 secret and decodes the HSM secret\r\n- Clarified why invalid prefix test vectors were bad (their checksum is for \"ms\" but their prefix is not \"ms\")\r\n- We might want to add one that uses \"cl\" with the old \"ms\" checksum code as that will now fail with the updated `ms32_verify_checksum` function\r\n\r\n",

(The simplest solution is to just use ECC with key length on the existing RSA derivation, but that doesn't seem very consistent with how BIP85 works for other similar use cases where the derivation path should tell you everything you need to know about the output data/entropy/usage)\r\n\r\nWhile it would have been nice to have a separate derivation level for key_type, that ship has probably sailed, so rather than add that, I am just suggesting a different applicationID for each key type. (Similar to how variations are handled with the existing password application type)\r\n\r\nWhile I'm at it, I'm also suggesting some information about how additional and mixed key types should be handled.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just keen to get some input on a way forward, can add some additional test vectors and stuff once others have provided some input about a preferred way forward.",

      "title": "Caution on tweaking in bip 327",
      "body": "The BIP is quite difficult to parse in terms of understanding the functionality and safety of tweaking keys.\r\n\r\nIn particular, while it is a terrible idea for more than one reason, constructing a MuSig2 aggregated key using related (bip32 unhardened) individual keys in the list is very specifically insecure, but that is not noted.\r\n\r\nIt's admittedly debatable whether you ever have to specify that a certain kind of stupid behaviour is to be warned against, but my justification is:\r\n\r\n1. The BIP is very explicitly \"supporting tweaking\" right from the Abstract. It isn't immediately clear that this means tweaking the ouput, not the input. Perhaps a minor note early on would help with that.\r\n\r\n2. Pre- this patch, in the section I'm editing, the document again explicitly says it supports tweaking, and this time, in relation to the *input* keys. It then goes on to explain the background of the attack outlined on the mailing list (I updated to a gnusha link: https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/576db60c-b05b-5b9a-75e5-9610f3e04eda@gmail.com/ ), which is much more \"in scope\" in the sense that the honest signer behaviour isn't stupid, but at the same time, the conditions of that attack are quite obscure.\r\n\r\n3. While the behaviour is stupid, it's not inconceivable, and it sits within perhaps the most likely/common usage pattern of MuSig2: multisig for better cold storage/savings security. Multiple keys controlled by the same signer, using multiple hardware devices for redundant security. As noted by Jonas Nick in an earlier email convo we had, there is at least one reason such stupid behaviour might be considered: less backup (and/or laziness). I admit that a large majority would have the common sense to not reuse the same wallet seed across devices, but in case anyone did it, they are exposed in a specific way that is very unobvious.\r\n\r\n4. To generalize the above, for me the BIP is not sufficiently explicit that the design of the MuSig2 algorithm does not address the possibility of related input keys at all (and it would be easy as an engineer consumer to assume that related keys would be safe, if they didn't look at the mathematical formulas too much).\r\n\r\nIf you want a concrete description of the attack, here you go (see Appendix A.2 of [DahLIAS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/692) for what I mean by \"multipliers:\"):\r\n\r\n2 devices set up with one secret key each, where the keys are on the same branch so that sk1 = sk2 + t for \"public\" t (handwave).\r\n\r\nThe network is compromised by the attacker. It exchanges messages with device 1 (sk1); receives nonces, maliciously calculates the response nonces (with the multipliers), receives a partial sig for sk1 and can complete the signing protocol just from knowing t.\r\n\r\nThe higher-level idea here is (I'm cribbing from an earlier email I wrote):\r\n\r\n> ... which I think nicely illustrates something that occurred to me earlier: there's a question of \"what is authorization?\" being raised here. In a single key signature, there is a single authorizing event, so we never worry too much about the \"semantics\" of the action of signing. It's one action, and it's all or nothing: you authorize, or you don't.\r\n\r\n> In multi-signing it's not atomic. The semantics of individual signing events are something decided on by the operator(s) of the protocol. I might want to say \"I authorize if and only if 3 different hardware devices sign\" (or 3 people or whatever). How does the security definition represent this? I believe the rationale for applying EUF-CMA as in the paper is \"we take a maximally pessimistic approach and assume that all except honest are the adversary, then we demand the adversary produce a signature without authorizing events from the honest signer\" on the basis that, if the honest signer did authorize, then there is no security failure (the honest signer wanted it!) - but that's exactly the point I'm questioning.\r\n\r\n> So it's back to the slightly confusion position of \"that this is possible is worrying, but all the obvious ways of exploiting it as a weakness reduce to an already fundamentally insecure multisig setup (using calculable tweaks of existing keys), and the base security model does not include this\" (\"capture\", perhaps).\r\n\r\n> Whimsically I wonder if this can be seen as analogous to EUF style security vs SUF style security: for most purposes you don't need strong unforgeability but it can cause implementation headaches if you don't have it (MtGox,  hehe).",

      "title": "Output Script Descriptor Annotations",
      "body": "This BIP proposal follows from the discussion for BIP392 (#2047) in which it emerged that due to the resource-intensive scanning requirements of the protocol some metadata (for example the birthday block height) may be practically required for efficient recovery of wallet funds. However, this metadata is not technically required to determine the output scripts, and therefore deemed unsuitable for direct inclusion in an output descriptor. This may lead to a situation in future where a wallet backup consisting of a valid output descriptor may not practically be complete enough to recover all the funds in a wallet.\r\n\r\nThis BIP proposal provides a solution in the form of annotations - key/value pairs appended to a descriptor expression using URL-like query string delimiters. Annotations provide a compact way to include such metadata directly in a descriptor string, using characters already present in the BIP380 checksum character set.\r\n\r\nNote that annotations are not intended for general wallet backup, which may include other data such as labels. They are strictly scoped to convey operational metadata to aid recovery of funds without altering the scripts produced by the descriptor.\r\n\r\ncc: @achow101 as author of most Descriptor BIPs.\r\n",

      "body": "codex32 string length limited to always cover HRP characters, master seed bit lengths limited to multiples of 32-bits, updated master seed encoding/decoding processes.\r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\n\r\nPR helper for #2040: prepares text for general HRP lengths by defining limits based on string length not data part length and deprecating master seed lengths that violate the new codex32 length rule. \r\n\r\n**Why**\r\nRestricting seeds to 32-bit multiples makes valid secret seed **lengths** differ by at least 6-7 characters reducing ambiguity to two valid lengths for _insert/delete_-correcting error correcting wallets. Restricting to 64-bit multiples has one valid length within correctable distance but @roconnor-blockstream wants 160-bit seeds.\r\n\r\n**Key changes** c286c2c5a7385113d33b3dd8cbda806bd371523f\r\n\r\n- Overall string max length for regular codex32 now limited to 94 chars. Payload changed from “up to 74” → up to 72 bech32 characters. \r\n- Long codex32: new length window (97–1024 characters) and payload allowance relaxed (up to 1001 bech32 chars). \r\n- Explain the checksum covers low HRP+data per BIP-0173.\r\n\r\n**Other changes:**\r\n\r\n- Remove \"decode\" from _Unshared Secret_ as this process should be application specific once HRP is generalized.\r\n- _Master seed format_ changes:\r\n  - Add \"decode\" section.\r\n  - Restrict seed lengths to 32-bit multiples (128-512) to avoid an \"ms\" exception for switching between regular and long format. Leaves our desired **128**-, **160**-, **192**-, 224-, **256**-bitlengths as well as many others.  \r\n  - Recommend how to derive unspecified identifiers for fresh and reshared secret seeds.\r\n  - Recommend deterministic implementations derive padding using a defined CRC code.\r\n- Defined a \"shared string\" as a non-\"0\" threshold parameter codex32 string.\r\n  - Defined how to \"decode\" these as implementers have been surprised naked share payload bytes are insufficient to recover the secret.\r\n- Defined a \"master share set\" as a _k_ shared strings valid set generated with exactly _k_-1 fresh shares in accordance with that section.  (needed for deriving reshare identifiers.) \r\n- Added a couple `<ref>` notes for the less obvious changes. \r\n- Fixed missing `/ref` so _Footnotes_ now appear at the end of _Rationale_ (they're invisible in master)\r\n- Bolded all section references.\r\n\r\n**Backward-compatibility and migration**\r\n- Existing codex32 strings that encode typical data lengths remain valid; however implementations may need to be adjusted that:\r\n  - Accepted codex32 strings 95 and 96 characters long.\r\n  - Rejected Long codex32 data-parts below 81 characters as the new HRP coverage allows them.\r\n  - Rejected codex32 string lengths below 48, equal to 97 or 98 and above 127 characters as codex32 now allows lengths 21 to 94 and 97 to 1024.\r\n\r\n**Test Vectors**\r\nI have a reference implementation with test vectors according to this spec update, as well as #2040, so I will add these if reviewers agree about the text changes.",
