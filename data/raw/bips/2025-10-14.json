      "body": "Fix test harness to correctly fail when public key generation does not match the expected vector. Previously, the “Failed key generation” branch only printed diagnostics without updating all_passed, leading to a false-positive overall test result. This is a bug because a keygen mismatch indicates an implementation error that must cause the test run to fail, consistent with how other failures in the harness set all_passed = False.",
