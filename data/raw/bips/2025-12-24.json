      "title": "BIP-327: correct DeterministicSign pubnonce and key length",
      "body": "The DeterministicSign specification currently describes pk_1..u as u 32-byte arrays and sets pubnonce = cbytes(R*_2) || cbytes(R*_2). Both statements conflict with the rest of BIP-0327, the Python reference implementation and the published test vectors. Individual public keys are plain compressed points of length 33 bytes everywhere else in the BIP, and the reference code derives pubnonce as cbytes(R*_1) || cbytes(R*_2), which is the format expected by NonceAgg and PartialSigVerify. This change updates the DeterministicSign section to use 33-byte plain public keys and to define pubnonce as (R*_1, R*_2), aligning the written specification with the existing reference implementation and test vectors without changing any executable code.",
