      "title": "BIP 89: Chain Code Delegation for Private Collaborative Custody",
      "body": "We propose a new BIP for Chain Code Delegation, a collaborative custody technique that involves privileged participants (delegatee) withholding BIP32 chain codes at key setup time from a delegator, and sharing only enough information for non‑privileged participants to provide their signature.\r\n\r\nFor non-blinded signing, the delegatee derives a per‑spend scalar tweak t from the (withheld) chain code, the delegator computes the child key (x+t, P+tG), and produces a standard signature over the transaction’s sighash. For blind signing, the nonce and challenge are blinded so the delegator returns a blind Schnorr signature that the counterparty unblinds; thanks to Schnorr’s linearity, the same tweak is incorporated without revealing the final message or linkable details (optionally with predicate proofs for policy).\r\n\r\nThis enables participants like collaborative custodians to co‑sign when needed, while avoiding the broad visibility that comes with holding an xpub.\r\n\r\nMore background and discussions can be found: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/chain-code-delegation-private-access-control-for-bitcoin-keys/1837. \r\n\r\nThis is joint work with @jesseposner.

      "title": "BIP445: FROST Signing Protocol for BIP340 Signatures",
      "body": "This PR adds a BIP for the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signing protocol. The development repository is at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing.\r\n\r\nThere already exists [RFC 9591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9591.html), which standardizes the two-round FROST signing protocol, but it is incompatible with Bitcoin's BIP340 X-only public keys. This BIP bridges that gap by providing a BIP340-compatible variant of FROST.\r\n\r\nThis BIP standardizes the FROST3 variant (Section 2.3 of the [ROAST paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550.pdf)). This variant shares significant similarities with the MuSig2 signing protocol (BIP327). Accordingly, this BIP follows the core design principles of [BIP327](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki), and many sections have been directly adapted from it.\r\n\r\nFROST key generation is out of scope for this BIP. There are sister BIPs such as [ChillDKG](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg) and [Trusted Dealer Generation](https://github.com/BEULAHEVANJALIN/bip-frost-trusted-dealer) that specify key generation mechanisms. This BIP must be used in conjunction with either of those for the full workflow from key generation to signature creation. Careful consideration has been taken to ensure the terminology in this BIP matches that of ChillDKG.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple (experimental) implementations of this specification:\r\n- The reference Python implementation included in this PR\r\n- [secp256k1-zkp FROST module](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/pull/278) (yet to implement the test vectors)\r\n- ~[FROST-BIP340](https://github.com/jesseposner/FROST-BIP340)~ TODO: verify if this impl is compatible with our test vectors\r\n- ~[secp256kfun](https://github.com/LLFourn/secp256kfun/blob/master/schnorr_fun/src/frost/session.rs) (implements ChillDKG with FROST signing)~ TODO: verify if this impl is compatible with our test vectors\r\n\r\n**Disclosure:** AI has been used to rephrase paragraphs for clarity, refactor certain sections of the reference code, and review pull requests made to the development repository. \r\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated! Please comment on this pull request or open an issue at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing for any feedback. Thank you!\r\n\r\ncc @jonasnick @real-or-random @jesseposner",

Clarify that the single byte message types are simply aliases for the longer equivalents, and that nodes should behave identically whether a message uses a one byte message_type or the equivalent 13-byte message type.\r\n\r\nAlso lowercases the message types (matching the on-the-wire encoding, rather than the Bitcoin Core constants), explicitly defines the payload's `message_length`, and adds a Version header and Changelog section.",

      "title": "BIP-374: vendor secp256k1lab and use it for reference implementation",
      "body": "Following up on the recent decision that [secp256k1lab](https://github.com/secp256k1lab/secp256k1lab) should be vendored per-BIP if needed/useful (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2004#issuecomment-3713521737 ff. and https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1855#issuecomment-3723682682 ff.), this PR exercises this for BIP-374. The changes add secp256k1lab version 1.0.0 as subtree [1] within the `bip-0374` folder and take use of it in the reference implementation. In particular, `secp256k1.py` is removed and the `TaggedHash` and `xor_bytes` routines are used from the secp256k1lab utils module, to simplify the code further. Usage of the library is mentioned in the BIP text to be license compliant (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2004#issuecomment-3723813845).\r\n\r\nCan be tested via:\r\n```\r\n$ ./bip-0374/run_test_vectors.py\r\n.....\r\nAll test vectors passed.\r\n$ ./bip-0374/gen_test_vectors.py\r\nGenerating /home/thestack/bips/bip-0374/test_vectors_generate_proof.csv...\r\nGenerating /home/thestack/bips/bip-0374/test_vectors_verify_proof.csv...\r\n$ git diff\r\n<shouldn't show any diffs, as generated .csv files should match the ones in the repository> \r\n```\r\n\r\n[1] added via the command `$ git subtree add --prefix=bip-0374/secp256k1lab --squash https://github.com/secp256k1lab/secp256k1lab v1.0.0`\r\n",
