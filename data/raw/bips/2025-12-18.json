      "body": "The version-rolling.min-bit-count field was previously documented as a TMask return value, even though the examples and real-world usage treat it as a request parameter with an integer bit count.\r\n\r\nThis change moves version-rolling.min-bit-count to the extension parameters section and changes its type to Integer (>= 0), keeping the original explanatory text. This makes the specification consistent with the JSON examples and with existing implementations of the stratum protocol extension.",

      "body": "Updated sequence diagrams to use text format instead of mermaid syntax responding to @achow101's [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1483#discussion_r2430441734)\r\n\r\nI cargo cult'd the RFC Rules:\r\n\r\n> “How are images handled for the plain text version of an RFC?”\r\n> The RFC Editor will accept both ASCII art and SVG. If only ASCII art is provided, it will be included in all publication formats. If ASCII art and SVG are both provided, ASCII art will be included in the plain text, and SVG in all other outputs. A note indicating alternative artwork is available is strongly advised. If only SVG is provided, a URI will be included in the plain-text publication format pointing to the HTML version. All artwork and figures should have a complete written description to support assisted reader technology.\r\n\r\nsee: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rse/format-faq/\r\n\r\nSince BIPs don't publish html/pdf renders, ASCII art seems like the right choice to render everywhere. Since normative prose is already provided, I chose not to include a written description of the diagrams to support assisted reader tech.\r\n\r\ncc @nothingmuch ",
