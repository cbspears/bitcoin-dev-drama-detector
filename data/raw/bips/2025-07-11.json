      "title": "Add internal hyperlinks to BIPs for improved readability",
      "body": "This pull request updates several BIP documents to include internal hyperlinks to other referenced BIPs using mediawiki format. These changes improve cross-referencing, readability, and navigation within the documentation.\r\nThe following updates were made:\r\nReplaced plain-text BIP references (e.g., \"BIP 34\") with mediawiki-style hyperlinks (e.g., [[bip-0034.mediawiki|BIP34]]).\r\nApplied changes across multiple BIP files, including bip-0008.mediawiki, bip-0017.mediawiki, and others.\r\nNo content logic was modified — only formatting and link enhancements were applied.",
