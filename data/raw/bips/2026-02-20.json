      "title": "BIP445: FROST Signing Protocol for BIP340 Signatures",
      "body": "This PR adds a BIP for the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signing protocol. The development repository is at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing.\r\n\r\nThere already exists [RFC 9591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9591.html), which standardizes the two-round FROST signing protocol, but it is incompatible with Bitcoin's BIP340 X-only public keys. This BIP bridges that gap by providing a BIP340-compatible variant of FROST.\r\n\r\nThis BIP standardizes the FROST3 variant (Section 2.3 of the [ROAST paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550.pdf)). This variant shares significant similarities with the MuSig2 signing protocol (BIP327). Accordingly, this BIP follows the core design principles of [BIP327](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki), and many sections have been directly adapted from it.\r\n\r\nFROST key generation is out of scope for this BIP. There are sister BIPs such as [ChillDKG](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg) and [Trusted Dealer Generation](https://github.com/BEULAHEVANJALIN/bip-frost-trusted-dealer) that specify key generation mechanisms. This BIP must be used in conjunction with either of those for the full workflow from key generation to signature creation. Careful consideration has been taken to ensure the terminology in this BIP matches that of ChillDKG.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple (experimental) implementations of this specification:\r\n- The reference Python implementation included in this PR\r\n- [secp256k1-zkp FROST module](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/pull/278) (yet to implement the test vectors)\r\n- ~[FROST-BIP340](https://github.com/jesseposner/FROST-BIP340)~ TODO: verify if this impl is compatible with our test vectors\r\n- ~[secp256kfun](https://github.com/LLFourn/secp256kfun/blob/master/schnorr_fun/src/frost/session.rs) (implements ChillDKG with FROST signing)~ TODO: verify if this impl is compatible with our test vectors\r\n\r\n**Disclosure:** AI has been used to rephrase paragraphs for clarity, refactor certain sections of the reference code, and review pull requests made to the development repository. \r\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated! Please comment on this pull request or open an issue at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing for any feedback. Thank you!\r\n\r\ncc @jonasnick @real-or-random @jesseposner",

      "title": "BIP-352: introduce per-group recipient limit K_max (=1000)",
      "body": "As previously announced in the [libsecp256k1 `silentpayments` module discussion](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3842046237) and on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/tgcAQVqvzVg) ~2 weeks ago, this PR introduces a `K_max` limit to BIP-352 to mitigate worst-case scanning time for adversarial transactions. So far [no objections have been raised](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3891774608) against that protocol change, which is backwards-incompatible in theory.\r\n\r\nThe Python reference implementation is adapted and test vectors for the following two scenarios are added:\r\n* Sending fails if any recipient group (i.e. recipients that share the same scan public key) exceeds the limit\r\n* Scanning only detects outputs with k values up to K_max (exclusive, i.e. from k=0..999), even if more would be available \r\n\r\nCan be tested by running `$ ./bip-0352/reference.py ./bip-0352/send_and_receive_test_vectors.json`. The test vectors pass the tests in the [libsecp256k1 module](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765) as well, see commit https://github.com/theStack/secp256k1/commit/7ae84f8971ce36ab5cb9a7af30c436dd42d34ea2. [1] \r\n\r\nNote that the value K_max=1000 is somewhat arbitrary and can still be debated, it's simply one that came up relatively early in the discussion and is believed to be fine even for very unusual scenarios like \"exchange sends to another exchange\"  (see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3773155788). An alternative number that was brought up later was K_max=2324, as this is the theoretical maximum for standard-sized (i.e. <= 100_000 kvB) transactions (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3789112995). Personally I think even a lower limit than K_max=1000 would be fine, like something in the \"lower hundreds\" range, but with 1000 we are still comfortably in the \"seconds\" range for the worst-case on a reasonably modern machine. See benchmark results https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765#issuecomment-3862265628 for more details.\r\n\r\nAnother suggested BIP change is introducing a [warning about wallet interoperability](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765#issuecomment-3910051227) w.r.t. the number of labels created. As I see this as an orthogonal change, I will open a separate PR for this. One slightly related PR is https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2087, which would standardize the EC parts of the reference code and make it look a bit nicer. It's not strictly necessary, but I'm happy to rebase this PR if #2087 gets in first.\r\n\r\n[1] I haven't included this commit in the secp PR yet as it's unclear to me if we want to bloat the repository with >120k new LOC and several mega-bytes of additional test data, considering a test case for this already exists. Something to be discussed further in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765.",

      "title": "BIP Draft: Output Script Descriptor Annotations",
      "body": "This BIP proposal follows from the discussion for BIP392 (#2047) in which it emerged that due to the resource-intensive scanning requirements of the protocol some metadata (for example the birthday block height) may be practically required for efficient recovery of wallet funds. However, this metadata is not technically required to determine the output scripts, and therefore deemed unsuitable for direct inclusion in an output descriptor. This may lead to a situation in future where a wallet backup consisting of a valid output descriptor may not practically be complete enough to recover all the funds in a wallet.\r\n\r\nThis BIP proposal provides a solution in the form of annotations - key/value pairs appended to a descriptor expression using URL-like query string delimiters. Annotations provide a compact way to include such metadata directly in a descriptor string, using characters already present in the BIP380 checksum character set.\r\n\r\nNote that annotations are not intended for general wallet backup, which may include other data such as labels. They are strictly scoped to convey operational metadata to aid recovery of funds without altering the scripts produced by the descriptor.\r\n\r\ncc: @achow101 as author of most Descriptor BIPs.\r\n",
