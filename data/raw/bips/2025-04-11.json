      "body": "BIP3 got a bit more review from @RubenSomsen, @darosior, and @jonatack. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the review. Most of it related to minor phrasing improvements, typos, and added emphasis.\r\n\r\nI also added mention of the Version header and Changelog to the Backward Compatibility section which I had overlooked, and explain why I consider the headers \"Superseded-by\" and \"Replaces\" asymmetric, and only propose a new name for \"Superseded-by\" but retain \"Replaces\".\r\n\r\n**This PR includes a deletion and readdition of the entire BIP 3, so as to provide further reviewers a surface to leave [comments directly on the BIP text](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1819/commits/3ec810e7c483a3896ce3221e9da2920306736251).** These two commits will disappear without a trace when the PR is later squash-merged.",
