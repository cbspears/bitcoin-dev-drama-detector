By including the `plaintext` in the nonce, you do address that concern.\r\n\r\nHowever it still seems unwise to mess with cryptographic standards.

The proposal is very much a work in progress.\r\n\r\nI only just found this discussion so am reading through it to compare it to my proposal. The descriptor backup in the \"Wallet Payload\" of my proposal seems to have some overlap with the BIP proposed here. If there is too much overlap I may reconsider progressing with my proposal.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, my proposal is very much a work in progress but the wallet payload proposal can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/KeysSoze/7109a7f0455897b1930f851bde6337e3\r\n\r\nMaybe jump to the test vector section to see what a basic backup of a descriptor and some meta data would look like prior to encryption.\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/KeysSoze/7109a7f0455897b1930f851bde6337e3#test-vectors\r\n\r\nAs my proposal is designed to be modular and extensible the encryption envelopes may be extended to offer Multiparty Encryption and Authentication.
