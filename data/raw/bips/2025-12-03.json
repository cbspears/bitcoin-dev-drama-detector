      "title": "BIP Draft: Silent Payment Output Script Descriptors",
      "body": "This builds on and provides an alternative to #2026, which references an [earlier discussion](https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2024-04/silent-payment-descriptors). Instead of modifying BIP352, a new output descriptor format is proposed in the style of BIPs 381-387. \r\n\r\nSimilar to #2026 key expressions starting with `spscan` and `spspend` are specified, but contain only version and key material information. The wallet birthday and additional labels are specified as optional additional arguments in the output descriptor format.\r\n\r\nBIP352 authors: @josibake @RubenSomsen\r\n\r\nMail list discussion: https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/bP6ktUyCOJI",
