      "title": "BIP327: remove unused Any import",
      "body": "The Any type from typing was imported in bip-0327/reference.py but never used. This likely originated from copying the import header from the BIP-0340 reference, where Any is used (e.g., in pretty(v: Any)), but in BIP-0327 there is no such usage. Removing it cleans up the imports without changing behavior.",
