      "title": "BIP374: add subtraction operator for GE class",
      "body": "This commit implements the subtraction operator (__sub__) for the GE (Group Element) class in the secp256k1.py file as requested in the TODO comment in reference.py.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is straightforward, leveraging the existing __neg__ method to define subtraction as addition with the negated element: self + (-a).\r\n\r\nAfter implementing the operator, the code in reference.py was simplified by replacing expressions like:\r\ns * G + (-e * A) with s * G - e * A\r\n\r\nThis makes the code more readable and directly matches the mathematical notation used in the BIP-0374 specification.",

The subtraction operator implementation [matches the one in secp256k1lab](https://github.com/secp256k1lab/secp256k1lab/blob/44dc4bd893b8f03e621585e3bf255253e0e0fbfb/src/secp256k1lab/secp256k1.py#L314-L316), a library which might be used in the future to unify all reference implementations in the BIPs repo that use the secp256k1 curve (it's still unclear on how to exactly do this though).\r\n> \r\n> Nit: I think the two commits could just be squashed, with a descriptive commit message? Not sure how strict we are in the BIPs repo, but the new operator shouldn't be used before it's introduced, so if you plan to keep it divided into two commits, they should be swapped.\r\n\r\nDone",
