      "title": "BIP 54: Consensus Cleanup",
      "body": "This is a BIP draft for a Consensus Cleanup soft fork.\r\n\r\nThis proposal builds upon Matt Corallo's 2019 [proposal](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bips/blob/7f9670b643b7c943a0cc6d2197d3eabe661050c2/bip-XXXX.mediawiki), which i set to revive at the end of 2023. I eventually shared my research in a [Delving Bitcoin post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/great-consensus-cleanup-revival/710) in early 2024 (along with a [semi-private companion post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/worst-block-validation-time-inquiry/711) for the redacted sensitive details). A number of people contributed ideas, testing and otherwise fruitful discussion. This led to settling on a list of mitigations, which [i updated the mailing list about](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/jiyMlvTX8BnG71f75SqChQZxyhZDQ65kldcugeIDJVJsvK4hadCO3GT46xFc7_cUlWdmOCG0B_WIz0HAO5ZugqYTuX5qxnNLRBn3MopuATI=@protonmail.com) in February 2025.\r\n\r\nI think it's now ready to be officially published as a BIP.",
