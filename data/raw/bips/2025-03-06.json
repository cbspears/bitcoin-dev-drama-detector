      "title": "BIP-0094: reformat specification section for clarity and readability",
      "body": "In this commit, we restructure the specification section to make the consensus rules clearer and more scannable. The previous section interleaved commentary and historical tidbits with the motivation and new rules, making it difficult to quickly identify the exact rule changes.\r\n\r\nA high level over view the intended changes is as follows:\r\n- Numbers each rule for easier reference\r\n- Adds explicit \"Rule Specification\" sections\r\n- Uses structured lists with MUST statements following RFC/IETF conventions\r\n- Provides a clear problem statement before each solution\r\n- Separates explanatory text from the actual rules\r\n\r\nI was reviewing a PR to btcd to implement testnet4, and found it hard to scan the BIP to find the actual new rules, which inspired this PR.
