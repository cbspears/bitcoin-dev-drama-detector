      "title": "chore: improve key parsing logic and fix premature termination issues",
      "body": "fixed several parsing bugs in key handling logic:\r\n\r\n* **find_key_end_position:** removed `'/'` from the set of terminating characters. This prevents derivation paths like `.../44'/0'/0'/...` from being truncated at the first `/`.\r\n* **parse_key_expressions:** implemented proper parenthesis depth tracking for `musig(...)` expressions instead of stopping at the first `)`, allowing correct parsing of nested expressions.\r\n* **parse_key_expressions:** added boundary checks (`key_pos_end < len(descriptor)`) before indexing `descriptor[key_pos_end]` to avoid `IndexError` at string ends.\r\n\r\nthese changes ensure the parser correctly handles complex key expressions and avoids crashes on edge cases.\r\n",

          "body": "The code is meant mostly for illustrative purposes. However:\r\n- find_key_end_position definitely intends to truncate at the first `/`\r\n- nested `musig` is explicitly forbidden by the specifications in BIP-388 (and, today, by descriptors)\r\n- pretty sure `key_pos_end` can never be larger than or equal to `len(descriptor)`, by construction.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think those are improvements.
