      "title": "380: Disallow H as a hardened indicator",
      "body": "It seems that there are few/no software that produce descriptors using `H`, while few accept it during parsing. As neither of the reference implementations of Bitcoin Core nor rust-miniscript support `H` at all, it seems to be better to remove `H` as a hardened indicator from the BIP rather than updating all of the existing software.\r\n\r\nI asked about this on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/IAYEx4zUhHA) last week and have received no responses. There was also some discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32788.",
