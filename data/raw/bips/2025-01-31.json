That’s probably a good way to look at it: if another BIP specifies a new field, that BIP is the authoritative document and the field specification is merely mirrored into BIP 174 for the convenience of the audience. In so far, it would be sufficient to get the sign-off of the author of the new BIP, and I might have been a bit too nitpicky.—I still think that adding a new field may need slightly less attention than changing an existing value, but all good, let’s move on.",
