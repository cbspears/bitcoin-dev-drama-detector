Did you have any issues?\r\n\r\nDetails in comment above - PSBT v2 not supported\r\n> * I would consider copying the approach taken in #2084, and use `secp256k1lab` here.\r\n\r\nI agree that approach is better than the current bip-0374 import.  The current import process would have to adapt to that change regardless.  I'll put that on the list for the next revision.\r\n> * As each PSBT change is reflected in BIP 174, maybe is worth moving the parsing, fields and PSBT validation logic to BIP 174 directory, and keep the role logic of each protocol on its own directory, like here.\r\n\r\nInteresting idea.  Are you suggesting a storage change for this PR or expand the scope of the PSBT parsing, fields and validation to v0 and other v2 fields and move to other BIPS directories?\r\n\r\n",
