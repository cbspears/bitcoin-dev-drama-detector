          "body": "This PR has several issues. First, all the words in `arabic.txt` are reversed, but Arabic is a right-to-left (RTL) language, so they should appear correctly. Additionally, there are very few (if any) widely used Arabic Bitcoin wallets, making this change of questionable value.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it's unclear which variant of Arabic is being used here (e.g., Modern Standard Arabic, a specific dialect, etc.), which could lead to usability problems.",

Nevertheless, am closing here, as the BIP39 authors no longer support further wordlists except for the English one, in order to maximize interoperability (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1395#issuecomment-2080782972). Also, per BIP39: \"Since the vast majority of BIP39 wallets supports only the English wordlist, it is **strongly discouraged** to use non-English wordlists for generating the mnemonic sentences.\" Thanks again.",

This script is meant to be run in Github Actions. It's not meant to be run by users, and doesn't need \"better safety\". I have no strong opinion on the subject though so if others think this is useful, go ahead.",
