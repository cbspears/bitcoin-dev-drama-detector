      "title": "BIP draft: Consensus ScriptPubKey Length Limit",
      "body": "This BIP adds a length limit for new scriptPubKeys in transactions at or above the activation height.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2017 (\"Reduced Data Temporary Softfork\") includes a similar mechanism among many other, more complex, and, in my opinion, more risky changes. It would be valuable to consider a scriptPubKey length limit in isolation. This BIP would be a permanent change, and the same limit would apply to OP_RETURN and non-OP_RETURN outputs.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your feedback.\r\n\r\nEdits:\r\n- The length limit applies to all blocks except those with a height that's a multiple of 256. In other words, one out of every 256 blocks is exempt. This allows pre-signed transactions containing large scriptPubKeys to be mined, just at a throttled rate, which should fully eliminate any “confiscation” concerns.",

Since Bitcoin lacks proper covenants pre-signed, deleted key transactions are the only way to do certain relative time-lock spends. I have no idea why they would also use an absolute time-lock in such a security solution.\r\n\r\nPS: It's also trivially possible to limit the total number of bytes new outputs in violation of the new rule can take up.",

And allowing every n-th block to circumvent the limit to prevent the confiscation \"FUD\" (for lack of a better term) **is** my original idea!

I really think it's valuable to consider a (higher) ScriptPubKey length limit separately from the rest of the RDTS.\r\n\r\nThe fact that my account is new is undeniable.
