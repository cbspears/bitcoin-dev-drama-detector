Discussed your question with Murch offline, and I think the only clear improvement over \"assigned\" would be a phrase that includes the word “date”, e.g., assignment date, date of number assignment, etc.\r\n\r\nFor now, we'll leave it as-is, and it can be improved later, if desired (for instance, after #1820).",

      "title": "BIP324: Fix features bitmask for decoding-case selection",
      "body": "Replace (features & 4) with (features & 3) in the four decoding-case checks. The docstring specifies that the lower two bits (f & 3) select which of x1/x2/x3 are valid. Using (features & 4) limited the value to {0,4}, making cases 1 and 2 unreachable and bypassing proper gating when bit 4 (u >= p) was set. This aligns implementation with the documented behavior and ensures all four modes are exercised correctly.",
