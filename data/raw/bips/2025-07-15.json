      "title": "Fix email validation regex to properly support subdomains",
      "body": "Improves the regular expressions for email validation to correctly handle email addresses with multiple domain levels (subdomains). The previous regex only supported single-level domains like example.com, while the new pattern properly validates addresses like user@mail.example.com. This change follows RFC 5322 standards for email addresses and maintains backward compatibility with existing valid addresses",
