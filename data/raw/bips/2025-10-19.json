      "title": "BIP-431: clarify Rule 3 to enforce cluster size 2 and fix inclusive counting",
      "body": "This change resolves an internal inconsistency in BIP-431 between Rule 3 and the “Related Work” section (and linked Core PRs) that assume clusters of at most size 2 for TRUC. Previously, Rule 3 allowed up to one unconfirmed ancestor and one unconfirmed descendant simultaneously, which permits a 3-transaction cluster (parent → tx → child). However, “Related Work” states “1-parent-1-child (aka cluster size 2)” and references features that rely on maximum cluster size 2 (feerate diagrams: PR 29242; package RBF: PR 28984; sibling eviction: PR 29306).\r\n\r\nwhat is the problem: \r\nRule 3 allowed “≤1 ancestor” and “≤1 descendant” at the same time, enabling a chain of three unconfirmed transactions.\r\n“Related Work” asserts “1-parent-1-child (aka cluster size 2)” and the referenced PRs constrain features to clusters of size ≤2, which is incompatible with a size-3 cluster.",

      "body": "Problem: In GenerateProof step 85 the self-check calls VerifyProof(A, B, C, proof) without G and m, but VerifyProof is defined as VerifyProof(A, B, C, proof, G, m). This omission breaks self-check when a non-empty message m is used or when a non-default generator G is passed.\r\n\r\nEvidence:\r\nSpec definition requires G and m:\r\n\r\n    The algorithm ''VerifyProof(A, B, C, proof, G, m)'' is defined as:\r\n    * Fail if any of ''is_infinite(A)'', ''is_infinite(B)'', ''is_infinite(C)'', ''is_infinite(G)''\r\n    * Let ''e = int(proof[0:32])''.\r\n    * Let ''s = int(proof[32:64])''; fail if ''s &ge; n''.\r\n    \r\nReference implementation passes G and m in the self-check:\r\nbip-0374/reference.py\r\n\r\n    proof = e.to_bytes(32, \\\"big\\\") + s.to_bytes(32, \\\"big\\\")\r\n    if not dleq_verify_proof(A, B, C, proof, G=G, m=m):\r\n        return None\r\n        \r\nGenerateProof includes m in challenge derivation and treats G as an input, so omitting them in VerifyProof recomputes a different challenge and will fail for non-empty m and non-default G.",
