There is one set of vectors per each of the 4 mitigations.\r\n\r\nThe vectors were generated using the BIP54 implementation against Bitcoin Inquisition available [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/99), as well as a custom miner as a Bitcoin Core unit test available [here](https://github.com/darosior/bitcoin/commits/bip54_miner/). Documentation is provided with more details about each set of test vectors and describing how to use them.",

The functional test sanity checks the implementation with a blackbox approach, but does not implement test vectors. Hence they don't need to be mentioned in the test vectors README.",

There are some suggestions that i believe to be overkill, but i think may be worth including: the marginal cost of an additional test case is overall quite low and if even the slightest reduction in risk of a bug in consensus code is probably worth it.\r\n\r\nThat said i think those can wait for a follow-up. I think what's here is a pretty solid base for anyone to start testing an implementation, and that the more overkill test cases can wait for now. I am also waiting for more feedback, and want to address all of it an once since it will require re-mining a bunch of blocks/headers.",

Somehow it can be worthy not only to test the correctness of the new consensus code w.r.t its BIP54 specification, but also to verify there is no unintended interaction of the novel code with things like p2p.",
