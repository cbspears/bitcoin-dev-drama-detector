      "title": "Remove BIP 174's claim that Combine is commutative",
      "body": "The BIP asserts that `fA(fB(psbt)) == fB(fA(psbt))`, however the explanatory text before this doesn't actually say this and even hints that the ordering does matter: \"processing [..] A and then B *in a sequence*\". It seems that the BIP text only supports the `Combine(fA(psbt), fB(psbt)) == fB(fA(psbt))` part, and that `fA(fB(psbt))` slipped in by accident?\r\n\r\nIn practice, Bitcoin Core's `combinepsbt` isn't commutative and gives precedence to latter PSBTs in the array. Here's a quick example demonstrating this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nPSBT_A=\"cHNidP8BADMCAAAAAa83fnb+Vw0gR7jZBeABQNh2dFx8F+MbmvHAM8N5+O07AAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAQUBUQA=\"\r\nPSBT_B=\"cHNidP8BADMCAAAAAa83fnb+Vw0gR7jZBeABQNh2dFx8F+MbmvHAM8N5+O07AAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAQUBUgA=\"\r\n$ bitcoin-cli decodepsbt $(bitcoin-cli combinepsbt [\\\"$PSBT_A\\\",\\\"$PSBT_B\\\"]) | jq -r .inputs[0].witness_script.asm\r\n1\r\n$ bitcoin-cli decodepsbt $(bitcoin-cli combinepsbt [\\\"$PSBT_B\\\",\\\"$PSBT_A\\\"]) | jq -r .inputs[0].witness_script.asm\r\n2\r\n````\r\n\r\nAnd here's a related discussion about rust-bitcoin's `Psbt::combine()`, which isn't commutative either but documented as \"*In accordance with BIP 174 this function is commutative*\": https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/issues/5486",
