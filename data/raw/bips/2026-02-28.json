      "body": "codex32 string length limited to always cover HRP characters, master seed bit lengths limited to multiples of 32-bits, updated master seed encoding/decoding processes.\r\n\r\nPR helper for #2040: prepares text for general HRP lengths by defining limits based on string length not data part length and deprecating master seed lengths that violate a general codex32 string length > checksum type rule.\r\n\r\n**Why**\r\nRestricting seeds to 32-bit multiples makes valid secret seed **lengths** differ by at least 6-7 characters reducing ambiguity to two valid lengths for _insert/delete_-correcting error correcting wallets.\r\n\r\n**Key changes** c286c2c5a7385113d33b3dd8cbda806bd371523f\r\n\r\n- Overall string max length for regular codex32 now limited to 94 chars. Payload changed from “up to 74” → up to 72 bech32 characters. \r\n- Long codex32: new length window (97–1024 characters) and payload allowance relaxed (up to 1001 bech32 chars). \r\n- Explain the checksum covers low HRP+data per BIP-0173.\r\n\r\n**Other changes:**\r\n\r\n- Remove \"decode\" from _Unshared Secret_ as this process should be application specific once HRP is generalized.\r\n- _Master seed format_ changes:\r\n  - Add \"decode\" section.\r\n  - Restrict seed lengths to 32-bit multiples (128-512) to avoid an \"ms\" exception for switching between regular and long format.\r\n  - Recommend how to derive unspecified identifiers for fresh and reshared secret seeds.\r\n  - Recommend deterministic implementations derive padding using a defined CRC code.\r\n- Defined a \"shared string\" as a non-\"0\" threshold parameter codex32 string.\r\n  - Defined how to \"decode\" these as implementers have been surprised naked share payload bytes are insufficient to recover the secret.\r\n- Defined a \"master share set\" as a _k_ shared strings valid set generated with exactly _k_-1 fresh shares in accordance with that section.  (needed for deriving reshare identifiers.) \r\n- Added a couple `<ref>` notes for the less obvious changes. \r\n- Fixed missing `/ref` so _Footnotes_ now appear at the end of _Rationale_ (they're invisible in master)\r\n- Bolded all section references.\r\n\r\n**Test Vectors**\r\nI have a reference implementation with test vectors according to this spec update, as well as #2040, so I will add these if reviewers agree about the text changes.",

This has caused many links around the web to become broken.\r\n\r\n# Redirect web service\r\n\r\n[gnusha.org/url](https://gnusha.org/url) is a web service that redirects old style archive urls to a new location where the content can be viewed.\r\n\r\nFor example, a bitcoin-dev mailing list archive url like:\r\n\r\n`https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-June/014472.html`\r\n\r\nusing `https://gnusha.org/url/https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-June/014472.html`\r\n\r\nis redirected to:\r\n\r\n`https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/ogoa6o$o4s$1@blaine.gmane.org/`\r\n\r\nThe redirect mappings were generated from my archives and you can review the scripts I made to do that here:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/kanzure/4e7bcc58344ceaa1a668e65a434adb2b\r\n\r\n# Alternative\r\n\r\nInstead of using `gnusha.org/url`, another option would be to resolve all of the archive urls to their email `Message-ID` redirects for the bitcoin-dev mailing list and use those urls instead. In fact, either [gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev) or https://mailing-list.bitcoindevs.xyz/bitcoindev/ could be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThose links would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CABaSBaxDjj6ySBx4v+rmpfrw4pE9b=JZJPzPQj_ZUiBg1HGFyA@mail.gmail.com/\r\nhttps://mailing-list.bitcoindevs.xyz/bitcoindev/CABaSBaxDjj6ySBx4v+rmpfrw4pE9b=JZJPzPQj_ZUiBg1HGFyA@mail.gmail.com/\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this is the preferred solution for the BIPs, then let me know how I can help. Take a look [here](https://gist.github.com/kanzure/4e7bcc58344ceaa1a668e65a434adb2b).\r\n\r\nFinally, one other alternative is to wait and do nothing.

The proposal aims to address the potential vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing while preserving backward compatibility with existing Bitcoin infrastructure.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nAbstract: QES2 leverages a dual-signature mechanism to incorporate both a post-quantum signature and a classical ECDSA signature into Bitcoin transactions.\r\n\r\nMotivation: With the emerging threat of quantum computers, classical cryptographic methods may become vulnerable. QES2 presents a transitional solution that enhances security during the shift towards quantum-safe systems.\r\n\r\nSpecification: The BIP outlines the structure, key generation, signing, and verification methods for the hybrid scheme.\r\n\r\nRationale: The hybrid approach ensures that if one signature method is compromised, the other still provides protection, offering a balanced trade-off between security and backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nReference Implementation: A reference implementation will be linked later for further review and testing.",

      "title": "Caution on tweaking in bip 327",
      "body": "The BIP is quite difficult to parse in terms of understanding the functionality and safety of tweaking keys.\r\n\r\nIn particular, while it is a terrible idea for more than one reason, constructing a MuSig2 aggregated key using related (bip32 unhardened) individual keys in the list is very specifically insecure, but that is not noted.\r\n\r\nIt's admittedly debatable whether you ever have to specify that a certain kind of stupid behaviour is to be warned against, but my justification is:\r\n\r\n1. The BIP is very explicitly \"supporting tweaking\" right from the Abstract. It isn't immediately clear that this means tweaking the ouput, not the input. Perhaps a minor note early on would help with that.\r\n\r\n2. Pre- this patch, in the section I'm editing, the document again explicitly says it supports tweaking, and this time, in relation to the *input* keys. It then goes on to explain the background of the attack outlined on the mailing list (I updated to a gnusha link: https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/576db60c-b05b-5b9a-75e5-9610f3e04eda@gmail.com/ ), which is much more \"in scope\" in the sense that the honest signer behaviour isn't stupid, but at the same time, the conditions of that attack are quite obscure.\r\n\r\n3. While the behaviour is stupid, it's not inconceivable, and it sits within perhaps the most likely/common usage pattern of MuSig2: multisig for better cold storage/savings security. Multiple keys controlled by the same signer, using multiple hardware devices for redundant security. As noted by Jonas Nick in an earlier email convo we had, there is at least one reason such stupid behaviour might be considered: less backup (and/or laziness). I admit that a large majority would have the common sense to not reuse the same wallet seed across devices, but in case anyone did it, they are exposed in a specific way that is very unobvious.\r\n\r\n4. To generalize the above, for me the BIP is not sufficiently explicit that the design of the MuSig2 algorithm does not address the possibility of related input keys at all (and it would be easy as an engineer consumer to assume that related keys would be safe, if they didn't look at the mathematical formulas too much).\r\n\r\nIf you want a concrete description of the attack, here you go (see Appendix A.2 of [DahLIAS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/692) for what I mean by \"multipliers:\"):\r\n\r\n2 devices set up with one secret key each, where the keys are on the same branch so that sk1 = sk2 + t for \"public\" t (handwave).\r\n\r\nThe network is compromised by the attacker. It exchanges messages with device 1 (sk1); receives nonces, maliciously calculates the response nonces (with the multipliers), receives a partial sig for sk1 and can complete the signing protocol just from knowing t.\r\n\r\nThe higher-level idea here is (I'm cribbing from an earlier email I wrote):\r\n\r\n> ... which I think nicely illustrates something that occurred to me earlier: there's a question of \"what is authorization?\" being raised here. In a single key signature, there is a single authorizing event, so we never worry too much about the \"semantics\" of the action of signing. It's one action, and it's all or nothing: you authorize, or you don't.\r\n\r\n> In multi-signing it's not atomic. The semantics of individual signing events are something decided on by the operator(s) of the protocol. I might want to say \"I authorize if and only if 3 different hardware devices sign\" (or 3 people or whatever). How does the security definition represent this? I believe the rationale for applying EUF-CMA as in the paper is \"we take a maximally pessimistic approach and assume that all except honest are the adversary, then we demand the adversary produce a signature without authorizing events from the honest signer\" on the basis that, if the honest signer did authorize, then there is no security failure (the honest signer wanted it!) - but that's exactly the point I'm questioning.\r\n\r\n> So it's back to the slightly confusion position of \"that this is possible is worrying, but all the obvious ways of exploiting it as a weakness reduce to an already fundamentally insecure multisig setup (using calculable tweaks of existing keys), and the base security model does not include this\" (\"capture\", perhaps).\r\n\r\n> Whimsically I wonder if this can be seen as analogous to EUF style security vs SUF style security: for most purposes you don't need strong unforgeability but it can cause implementation headaches if you don't have it (MtGox,  hehe).",

(The simplest solution is to just use ECC with key length on the existing RSA derivation, but that doesn't seem very consistent with how BIP85 works for other similar use cases where the derivation path should tell you everything you need to know about the output data/entropy/usage)\r\n\r\nWhile it would have been nice to have a separate derivation level for key_type, that ship has probably sailed, so rather than add that, I am just suggesting a different applicationID for each key type.

      "body": "This pull request proposes a new BIP for a standard, interoperable format for encrypted wallet backups and transfers.\r\n\r\nThe core design choice is the separation of the data `payload` from the cryptographic `container`. This BIP specifies the `payload` format, while mandating that it must be encrypted by a container defined in companion proposals.\r\n\r\nKey features include:\r\n* **CBOR Serialisation:** Uses CBOR for a compact, efficient, and extensible binary format suitable for resource-constrained devices.\r\n* **Descriptor-Centric:** Aligns with modern wallet architecture by using BIP 380 Output Script Descriptors as the primary method for defining accounts.\r\n* **Comprehensive Data:** The schema includes accounts, master secret material, transaction data, UTXOs and standardised metadata.\r\n\r\nThis proposal was previously posted to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list: [https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/3I-qtBhzIGY](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/3I-qtBhzIGY)\r\n\r\nSeeking assignment of a BIP number and welcoming all feedback.",

Provided reference code for this checksum.\r\n\r\n**Test Vectors:**\r\n\r\n- Fixed the cornucopia of naming conventions in the Test vectors \r\n  - used mostly \"secret seed\", \"codex32 secret\", and \"codex32-encoded X\".\r\n- Fixed test vector 5 which did not actually append a long checksum to \"random\" data as the text said it would.\r\n- Added vector 6 encoding a \"cl\" prefix codex32-encoded HSM secret, then relabels the identifier (producing a new checksum and codex32-encoded HSM secret)\r\n- Added vector 7 which parses a \"cl\" prefix codex32 secret and decodes the HSM secret\r\n- Clarified why invalid prefix test vectors were bad (their checksum is for \"ms\" but their prefix is not \"ms\")\r\n- We might want to add one that uses \"cl\" with the old \"ms\" checksum code as that will now fail with the updated `ms32_verify_checksum` function\r\n\r\n",

It seems that the BIP text only supports the `Combine(fA(psbt), fB(psbt)) == fB(fA(psbt))` part, and that `fA(fB(psbt))` slipped in by accident?\r\n\r\nIn practice, Bitcoin Core's `combinepsbt` isn't commutative and gives precedence to latter PSBTs in the array.

      "title": "BIP-352: introduce per-group recipient limit K_max (=2324)",
      "body": "As previously announced in the [libsecp256k1 `silentpayments` module discussion](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3842046237) and on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/tgcAQVqvzVg) ~2 weeks ago, this PR introduces a `K_max` limit to BIP-352 to mitigate worst-case scanning time for adversarial transactions. So far [no objections have been raised](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3891774608) against that protocol change, which is backwards-incompatible in theory.\r\n\r\nThe Python reference implementation is adapted and test vectors for the following two scenarios are added:\r\n* Sending fails if any recipient group (i.e. recipients that share the same scan public key) exceeds the limit\r\n* Scanning only detects outputs with k values up to K_max (exclusive, i.e. from k=0..999), even if more would be available \r\n\r\nCan be tested by running `$ ./bip-0352/reference.py ./bip-0352/send_and_receive_test_vectors.json`. The test vectors pass the tests in the [libsecp256k1 module](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765) as well, see commit https://github.com/theStack/secp256k1/commit/65ce62310a27d54784952de41607d10aaab30218. [1] \r\n\r\n~~Note that the value K_max=1000 is somewhat arbitrary and can still be debated, it's simply one that came up relatively early in the discussion and is believed to be fine even for very unusual scenarios like \"exchange sends to another exchange\"  (see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3773155788). An alternative number that was brought up later was K_max=2324, as this is the theoretical maximum for standard-sized (i.e. <= 100_000 kvB) transactions (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3789112995). Personally I think even a lower limit than K_max=1000 would be fine, like something in the \"lower hundreds\" range, but with 1000 we are still comfortably in the \"seconds\" range for the worst-case on a reasonably modern machine.~~ // EDIT: the proposed value was raised from 1000 to 2324\r\n\r\nThe chosen value of Kmax = 2324 (suggested earlier in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3789112995 and in https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2106#issuecomment-3957817763 below) represents the maximum number of P2TR outputs that can fit into a 100kvB transaction, meaning a transaction that adheres to the current standardness rules is guaranteed to be within the limit. This ensures flexibility and also mitigates potential fingerprinting issues.\r\nSee benchmark results https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765#issuecomment-3862265628 for more details.\r\n\r\nAnother suggested BIP change is introducing a [warning about wallet interoperability](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765#issuecomment-3910051227) w.r.t. the number of labels created. As I see this as an orthogonal change, I will open a separate PR for this. One slightly related PR is https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2087, which would standardize the EC parts of the reference code and make it look a bit nicer. It's not strictly necessary, but I'm happy to rebase this PR if #2087 gets in first.\r\n\r\n[1] ~~I haven't included this commit in the secp PR yet as it's unclear to me if we want to bloat the repository with >120k new LOC and several mega-bytes of additional test data, considering a test case for this already exists. Something to be discussed further in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765.~~ // EDIT: after the test vector encoding improvements as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2106#issuecomment-3957958154, this is not an issue anymore",

However, this metadata is not technically required to determine the output scripts, and therefore deemed unsuitable for direct inclusion in an output descriptor. This may lead to a situation in future where a wallet backup consisting of a valid output descriptor may not practically be complete enough to recover all the funds in a wallet.\r\n\r\nThis BIP proposal provides a solution in the form of annotations - key/value pairs appended to a descriptor expression using URL-like query string delimiters. Annotations provide a compact way to include such metadata directly in a descriptor string, using characters already present in the BIP380 checksum character set.\r\n\r\nNote that annotations are not intended for general wallet backup, which may include other data such as labels. They are strictly scoped to convey operational metadata to aid recovery of funds without altering the scripts produced by the descriptor.\r\n\r\ncc: @achow101 as author of most Descriptor BIPs.\r\n",

      "title": "BIP445: FROST Signing Protocol for BIP340 Signatures",
      "body": "This PR adds a BIP for the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signing protocol. The development repository is at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing.\r\n\r\nThere already exists [RFC 9591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9591.html), which standardizes the two-round FROST signing protocol, but it is incompatible with Bitcoin's BIP340 X-only public keys. This BIP bridges that gap by providing a BIP340-compatible variant of FROST.\r\n\r\nThis BIP standardizes the FROST3 variant (Section 2.3 of the [ROAST paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550.pdf)). This variant shares significant similarities with the MuSig2 signing protocol (BIP327). Accordingly, this BIP follows the core design principles of [BIP327](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki), and many sections have been directly adapted from it.\r\n\r\nFROST key generation is out of scope for this BIP. There are sister BIPs such as [ChillDKG](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg) and [Trusted Dealer Generation](https://github.com/BEULAHEVANJALIN/bip-frost-trusted-dealer) that specify key generation mechanisms. This BIP must be used in conjunction with either of those for the full workflow from key generation to signature creation. Careful consideration has been taken to ensure the terminology in this BIP matches that of ChillDKG.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple (experimental) implementations of this specification:\r\n- The reference Python implementation included in this PR\r\n- [secp256k1-zkp FROST module](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/pull/278) (yet to implement the test vectors)\r\n- ~[FROST-BIP340](https://github.com/jesseposner/FROST-BIP340)~ TODO: verify if this impl is compatible with our test vectors\r\n- ~[secp256kfun](https://github.com/LLFourn/secp256kfun/blob/master/schnorr_fun/src/frost/session.rs) (implements ChillDKG with FROST signing)~ TODO: verify if this impl is compatible with our test vectors\r\n\r\n**Disclosure:** AI has been used to rephrase paragraphs for clarity, refactor certain sections of the reference code, and review pull requests made to the development repository. \r\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated! Please comment on this pull request or open an issue at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing for any feedback. Thank you!\r\n\r\ncc @jonasnick @real-or-random @jesseposner",

      "body": "Ordinal numbers are serial numbers for sats, assigned when mined and preserved across transactions.\r\n\r\nI originally posted an earlier draft of the BIP to [bitcoin-dev](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-February/019975.html) in February of last year.\r\n\r\nWe've implemented a wallet and block explorer, with public instances on [mainnet](http://ordinals.com/), [signet](http://signet.ordinals.com/), and [testnet](https://testnet.ordinals.com), and a [wallet](https://github.com/casey/ord) that uses sat control to ensure specific sats are transferred to specific outputs. Constructing such transactions is tricky, especially given the dust limit and doing proper fee estimation, but once you get the details right it works well, and the fact that such transactions are otherwise normal Bitcoin transactions means that existing bitcoin infrastructure can be leveraged.\r\n\r\nSince we've been using ordinal numbers in production and getting some users of the software it seemed appropriate to request a BIP number.\r\n\r\nI've never applied for a BIP number before, so definitely let me know if anything should be changed or can be improved!",
