      "body": "The BIP asserts that `fA(fB(psbt)) == fB(fA(psbt))`, however the explanatory text before this doesn't actually say this and even hints that the ordering does matter: \"processing [..] A and then B *in a sequence*\". It seems that the BIP text only supports the `Combine(fA(psbt), fB(psbt)) == fB(fA(psbt))` part, and that `fA(fB(psbt))` slipped in by accident?\r\n\r\nIn practice, Bitcoin Core's `combinepsbt` isn't commutative and gives precedence to latter PSBTs in the array. Here's a quick example demonstrating this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nPSBT_A=\"cHNidP8BADMCAAAAAa83fnb+Vw0gR7jZBeABQNh2dFx8F+MbmvHAM8N5+O07AAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAQUBUQA=\"\r\nPSBT_B=\"cHNidP8BADMCAAAAAa83fnb+Vw0gR7jZBeABQNh2dFx8F+MbmvHAM8N5+O07AAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAQUBUgA=\"\r\n$ bitcoin-cli decodepsbt $(bitcoin-cli combinepsbt [\\\"$PSBT_A\\\",\\\"$PSBT_B\\\"]) | jq -r .inputs[0].witness_script.asm\r\n1\r\n$ bitcoin-cli decodepsbt $(bitcoin-cli combinepsbt [\\\"$PSBT_B\\\",\\\"$PSBT_A\\\"]) | jq -r .inputs[0].witness_script.asm\r\n2\r\n````\r\n\r\nAnd here's a related discussion about rust-bitcoin's `Psbt::combine()`, which isn't commutative either but documented as \"*In accordance with BIP 174 this function is commutative*\": https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/issues/5486",

      "title": "BIP-373: denote different public key types/purposes consistently",
      "body": "While reviewing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31247 a while ago I noticed that the mentioned public keys in the PSBT fields of this BIP are quite confusing. This is mostly due to a non-consistent mention of types (plain vs. x-only) and a purpose that is sometimes missing. This PR aims to improve this in the following ways:\r\n- be specific about the purpose of pubkey types in PSBT fields (\"plain pubkey\" alone doesn't say a lot, especially if it's used repeatedly within a field; explicitly call it \"aggregate pubkey\" or \"participant pubkey\" if applicable)\r\n- replace all uses of \"plain pubkey\" by \"compressed pubkey\" (the only category that should matter is whether the pubkey type is \"x-only\" or \"plain\")\r\n- use consistent word order, e.g. prefer \"compressed aggregate public key\" over \"aggregate compressed public key\"\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to even get rid of the \"plain/compressed\" terminology completely. From the fact that \"x-only\" is not explicitly mentioned and the size of 33 bytes it should be obvious that this is a plain public key.",

      "title": "BIP Draft: FROST Signing Protocol for BIP340 Signatures",
      "body": "This PR adds a BIP for the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signing protocol. The development repository is at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing.\r\n\r\nThere already exists [RFC 9591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9591.html), which standardizes the two-round FROST signing protocol, but it is incompatible with Bitcoin's BIP340 X-only public keys. This BIP bridges that gap by providing a BIP340-compatible variant of FROST.\r\n\r\nThis BIP standardizes the FROST3 variant (Section 2.3 of the [ROAST paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550.pdf)). This variant shares significant similarities with the MuSig2 signing protocol (BIP327). Accordingly, this BIP follows the core design principles of [BIP327](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki), and many sections have been directly adapted from it.\r\n\r\nFROST key generation is out of scope for this BIP. There are sister BIPs such as [ChillDKG](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg) and [Trusted Dealer Generation](https://github.com/BEULAHEVANJALIN/bip-frost-trusted-dealer) that specify key generation mechanisms. This BIP must be used in conjunction with either of those for the full workflow from key generation to signature creation. Careful consideration has been taken to ensure the terminology in this BIP matches that of ChillDKG.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple (experimental) implementations of this specification:\r\n- The reference Python implementation included in this PR\r\n- [secp256k1-zkp FROST module](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/pull/278) (yet to implement the test vectors)\r\n- [FROST-BIP340](https://github.com/jesseposner/FROST-BIP340)\r\n- ~[secp256kfun](https://github.com/LLFourn/secp256kfun/blob/master/schnorr_fun/src/frost/session.rs) (implements ChillDKG with FROST signing)~ TODO: verify if secp256k1fun passes our test vectors\r\n\r\n**Disclosure:** AI has been used to rephrase paragraphs for clarity, refactor certain sections of the reference code, and review pull requests made to the development repository. \r\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated! Please comment on this pull request or open an issue at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing for any feedback. Thank you!\r\n\r\ncc @jonasnick @real-or-random @jesseposner",

It's not clearly specified in the spec, and there are not many resources or parsers to aid in debugging PSBTv2. I found the BIP370 test vector \"Case: PSBTv0 but with PSBT_IN_PREVIOUS_TXID.\" seems to imply that the order of this txid value in `PSBT_IN_PREVIOUS_TXID` should match network serialization order.\r\n\r\nI'm torn on if \"little endian\" is the correct phrase to use here in conjunction with \"txid\". I usually think of a \"txid\" as the big endian, human-presented order of a txn hash, but maybe it's okay to use interchangeably. ",

      "body": "Updated sequence diagrams to use text format instead of mermaid syntax responding to @achow101's [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1483#discussion_r2430441734)\r\n\r\nI cargo cult'd the RFC Rules:\r\n\r\n> “How are images handled for the plain text version of an RFC?”\r\n> The RFC Editor will accept both ASCII art and SVG. If only ASCII art is provided, it will be included in all publication formats. If ASCII art and SVG are both provided, ASCII art will be included in the plain text, and SVG in all other outputs. A note indicating alternative artwork is available is strongly advised. If only SVG is provided, a URI will be included in the plain-text publication format pointing to the HTML version. All artwork and figures should have a complete written description to support assisted reader technology.\r\n\r\nsee: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rse/format-faq/\r\n\r\nSince BIPs don't publish html/pdf renders, ASCII art seems like the right choice to render everywhere. Since normative prose is already provided, I chose not to include a written description of the diagrams to support assisted reader tech.\r\n\r\ncc @nothingmuch ",
