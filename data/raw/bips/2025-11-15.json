Resubmitting exactly the same suggestions that I have already addressed without responding to any of my comments or further substantiation is not constructive and does not advance this conversation.\r\n\r\nI would also like to point out that it has been 34 days since I updated my proposal in response to your feedback and four weeks since Jon [asked](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2037#issuecomment-3658030137) here whether your points have been addressed fairly. You did not reply or “update your PR” until less than one hour after I emailed the mailing list that my activation proposal has been updated in response to several other correspondents assessing that BIP 3 has rough consensus. Your behavior could easily be understood as deliberately wasting people’s time and resources.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1151\" height=\"1158\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b77352ea-b108-4e83-8680-9ff1c4e99807\" />\r\n<img width=\"1145\" height=\"1023\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bc44050-f39a-4dd4-a0e1-1df148aebf96\" />\r\n<img width=\"1142\" height=\"756\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/404bcb41-5d68-4cd2-aba1-8726da60353c\" />\r\n<img width=\"1149\" height=\"1013\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0584b0a3-c709-4ef1-8bd1-f0199bd3026a\" />\r\n<img width=\"1142\" height=\"930\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27ebe066-0f8c-4741-aeae-1f8559c31970\" />\r\n<img width=\"1150\" height=\"899\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/090bc613-b7b9-4db2-b47a-983a61c5b3c2\" />",
