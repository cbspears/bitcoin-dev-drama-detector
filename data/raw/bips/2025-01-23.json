      "body": "If the goal is solely to move labels between cooperating wallets, then previously defined values are the absolute minimum needed. However, wallet data exports can serve other purposes and many values associated with\r\naddresses, transactions and outputs are already on-hand for the wallet generating the export, and yet would be hard or impossible for importing tools to reconstruct.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a bunch of optional fields that could be useful to users of this data. All are optional.",

          "body": "Below are my thoughts on specific fields and suggestions for improving the proposal while keeping it practical:\r\n\r\n**Block Height and Timestamps**\r\n\r\nIncluding the block height is very useful, especially for understanding transaction confirmation status. The timestamp, while useful in some cases, feels less critical. It can be derived if needed, and excluding it could simplify the format. \r\n\r\n**Transaction and Fees** \r\n\r\nFees are a tricky field to standardize, especially for batched or multi-party ownership transactions.\r\nShifting the focus to _inputs_ and _outputs_ rather than whole transactions and handling the fee on its own makes it a lot easier for me. \r\n\r\n**Fair Market Value and Rate** \r\n\r\nThe FMV field is probably the attribute I wanted the most. The problem with exchange rate is, that there are many of them and I would stick to one (your own) value. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Keypath** \r\n\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\n**Value (in sats)**\r\n\r\nWhile value (in sats) can be looked up using tools like Electrum, having it as part of the format is still a helpful convenience.\r\n\r\n**Heights for Addresses** \r\n\r\nNah. Address reuse is a bad practice.\r\n\r\nWhile it’s tempting to include some additional fields (mainly confirmation block height, MFV and value in sats) for richer metadata, I believe the BIP should stick to the smallest common denominator for simplicity and broad compatibility. Generally, I'm okay to store and parse metadata from the text label field and delegating more advanced data aggregation, management, and lookups to external tools and services, like labelbase.space. \r\n\r\nThat said, if @craigraw is open to merging changes into BIP-329, I am happy to adapt the [python-bip329](https://github.com/Labelbase/python-bip329) library to support these extensions and make them accessible on the Labelbase platform as well.\r\n\r\n",

I also believe that having nothing left to remove has its own value and justification, just as incorporating (some) of the requested changes does. IMHO, ensuring a vendor-agnostic standard that is widely adopted by both the industry and community is more important to me than the exact specifications. I think we should prioritize this aspect while still considering the details. \r\n",

Only mempool.space provides an open API for historical rates, and then only for the last couple of years in a handful of major currencies. However, this presents an interesting opportunity for server-based implementations, which can add the exchange rate fields by processing this format as an event stream, and may have less need for historical rate access.",

I am afraid that I do not know where your wordlist should be submitted eventually, since neither BIP39 nor the WLIPs seem to be looking to incorporate further lists. Perhaps this would be a topic to discuss with other Devnagri/Hindi speaking Bitcoin users.",
