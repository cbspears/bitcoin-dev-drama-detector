      "body": "I noticed an issue in the `__truediv__` method of the `FE` class where the division was being performed incorrectly. The method was returning `FE(self, a)`, which doesn’t account for the numerator and denominator fields (`_num` and `_den`). \r\n\r\nTo fix this, I’ve updated the code to return `FE(self._num, self._den * a)`, which properly creates a new `FE` object with the same numerator and the denominator multiplied by the given argument `a`.\r\n",
