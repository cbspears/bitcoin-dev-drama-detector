We usually no longer directly merge PRs of this type, as we have been seeing a high frequency of them, they generally require more time than they are worth, and they create unneeded notifications for subscribers to this repository. (There may be exceptions for higher-value proposals by longstanding reviewers of this repository.) We instead batch this type of changes into an occasional cleanup pull by the editors that might mention the authors of some of the more valuable typos found. Thanks again.",
