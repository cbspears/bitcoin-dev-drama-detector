Nevertheless, am closing here, as the BIP39 authors no longer support further wordlists except for the English one, in order to maximize interoperability (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1395#issuecomment-2080782972). Also, per BIP39: \"Since the vast majority of BIP39 wallets supports only the English wordlist, it is **strongly discouraged** to use non-English wordlists for generating the mnemonic sentences.\" Thanks again.",
