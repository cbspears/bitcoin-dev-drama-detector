      "body": "Update the recipients parameter in create_outputs from List[str] to List[Dict[str, str]]. This aligns the type annotation with actual usage in the code (recipient[\"address\"], recipient[\"scan_pub_key\"], recipient[\"spend_pub_key\"]) and matches the structure provided by the test vectors. The previous annotation was misleading and could cause static type checkers and IDEs to surface incorrect diagnostics.",

Update ECPubKey.verify_ecdsa to check (x(R) % n) == r, aligning verification with ECDSA as defined in SEC1/FIPS 186 and matching our signer’s behavior.",
