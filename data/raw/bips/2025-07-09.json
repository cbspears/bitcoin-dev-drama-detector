          "body": "After staring at this section and some BIP preambles for a while, a further suggestion is to drop \"License-Code\" entirely. It's used only by five BIPs so far ([BIP 98](/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0098.mediawiki), [BIP 116](/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0116.mediawiki), [BIP 117](/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0117.mediawiki), [BIP 330](/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0330.mediawiki), [BIP 340](/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki)), and I think it creates more ambiguity than it tries to resolve:\r\n\r\nFor BIP98, BIP116, and BIP 117 (some comments below apply to all of them but I list them only once):\r\n - BIP98 contains [\"source code\"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0098/unbalanced-hash-tree.dot) to render a diagram used in the document. Is this covered by \"License\" or by \"License-Code\"?\r\n - In fact, [all aux files of BIP98](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/tree/master/bip-0098) are either diagrams or their source code (or a shell script to build the diagrams).  I think what they meant with \"All provided source code is licensed under the MIT license.\" in the copyright section is that the reference implementation of the BIP is under MIT, but this reference implementation lives in [another repo](https://github.com/maaku/bitcoin/tree/fast-merkle-tree), which anyway has an explicit MIT license file as fork of Bitcoin Core.\r\n - BIP 116 contains a [Bitcoin script](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0116.mediawiki#1-of-n-for-large-n). I claim that this is source code. Is it covered by \"License\" or by \"License-Code\"?\r\n\r\nBIP330:\r\n - The Copyright section just says: \"This document is licensed under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license.\", not talking about a different license (MIT) for code at all. Which code should be under MIT? The implementation [in a PR to Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21515) or [this aux file](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0330/minisketch.py)?\r\n\r\nBIP340:\r\n - The \"License-Code\" header was introduced [only recently (by me)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1807) as part of changing the license of the code and the test vectors. But this was limited in scope to the code only to avoid obtaining permission from even more people. We should have started from scratch with everything under CC0 OR MIT.\r\n\r\nI feel that this just relying on this text in BIP3 would be a sufficient solution (here in the version after this PR but the one before was also good):\r\n\r\n> Each auxiliary source code file or source directory should specify the license under which it is made available as is\r\n> common in software (e.g., with a [`SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression>` comment](https://spdx.dev/ids/),\r\n> a license header, or a LICENSE/COPYING file). It is recommended to make any test vectors available under CC0-1.0 or\r\n> FSFAP in addition to any other licenses to allow anyone to copy test vectors into their implementations without\r\n> introducing license hindrances. Licenses listed in the License-Code header apply to all source directories, source code\r\n> files, and test vectors provided with the BIP except those where a LICENSE file in a directory or the file header states\r\n> otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf we stick to something like this, then licensing will be less ambiguous, and we should just drop License-Code. \r\n\r\nIt could still be rephrased a bit to say \"each auxiliary code file or directory made available under different terms than what is specified in the License header\" to clarify that the License header is meant to apply to all kinds of aux files, unless specified otherwise. And we'll need a note that old BIPs may have a License-Code header and simply refer to BIP2.\r\n\r\nYou could say that should belong to a larger overhaul of the legal stuff in BIP3 (see https://github.com/murchandamus/bips/pull/2#discussion_r1778882507 and https://github.com/murchandamus/bips/pull/2#issuecomment-2388682834), but I don't think that's the case. Dropping the header (only for new BIPs, of course) is purely an \"editorial\" thing and doesn't go into the actual legal issues, so I'd say it belongs to BIP3.\r\n\r\nYou could also say that I'm quite late with this comment, and I can't really argue against that...",

          "body": "Sorry for the changing line breaks! I don't like this either, but the line breaks were so consistent that I assumed you wanted me to reformat... I changed it back (first force-push to https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/commit/a50e1ca7e1633b4383839af7d2159d1bee22bc80) and also added a change to the \"Header Descriptions\" section, which I had overlooked (second force-push to https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/commit/88d29188c62dfafc94ac92b5f59d310a20bcef3d).\r\n\r\nAs a side note, what I highly recommend for new texts and BIPs is [Semantic Line Breaks](https://sembr.org/) (also called [Semantic Linefeeds](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/) or [Ventilated Prose](https://vanemden.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/ventilated-prose/)), i.e., having a line break after each substantial unit of thought. This makes it so much easier to reorganize thoughts during editing, and it also keeps the diffs clean. A similar, but slightly worse (if you ask me) advice is [having full sentence per line](https://sive.rs/1s), see also [here](https://hieuphay.com/one-sentence-per-line/).  \r\n\r\n> If you would like to add also text to drop the License-Code header I’d also support that, otherwise, I can add that as a follow-up to this PR.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to take care of it next week. I suggest a follow-up PR because this PR is ready from my side now. But I can also add commits here if you prefer that. Just let me know.",
