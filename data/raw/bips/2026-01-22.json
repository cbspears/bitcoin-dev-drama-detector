      "body": "**Summary of Changes:**\r\nDescribe codex32 format for arbitrary human-readable parts not just \"ms\", specify master seed encoding standard, add new test vectors and enhance readability. This makes the document more like BIP-0173: proposing an encoding \"codex32\", then defining a standard for something using it.\r\n\r\nSee discussion on https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2023#issuecomment-3538570493.\r\n\r\n**Spec:**\r\n- fixed the threshold mistake in the abstract\r\n- replaced \"master seed\" with \"secret\", prior to the \"Master seed format\" section and made descriptions hrp general\r\n- updated the checksum reference code to produce valid checksums for any `hrp`\r\n- change _t_ to _k_ to match the test vectors and book\r\n- defined \"ms\" codex32 secrets:\r\n  - using terms \"secret seed\" (as the book does) and \"codex32-encoded master seed\" to refer to \"ms\" codex32 secrets\r\n  - recommended using first 4 characters of the bech32-encoded fingerprint as the identifier\r\n  - recommended the padding bits be set with a CRC code for extra error detection. Provided reference code for this checksum.\r\n\r\n**Test Vectors:**\r\n\r\n- Fixed the cornucopia of naming conventions in the Test vectors \r\n  - used mostly \"secret seed\", \"codex32 secret\", and \"codex32-encoded X\".\r\n- Fixed test vector 5 which did not actually append a long checksum to \"random\" data as the text said it would.\r\n- Added vector 6 encoding a \"cl\" prefix codex32-encoded HSM secret, then relabels the identifier (producing a new checksum and codex32-encoded HSM secret)\r\n- Added vector 7 which parses a \"cl\" prefix codex32 secret and decodes the HSM secret\r\n- Clarified why invalid prefix test vectors were bad (their checksum is for \"ms\" but their prefix is not \"ms\")\r\n- We might want to add one that uses \"cl\" with the old \"ms\" checksum code as that will now fail with the updated `ms32_verify_checksum` function\r\n\r\n",

      "title": "BIP Draft: FROST Signing Protocol for BIP340 Signatures",
      "body": "This PR adds a BIP for the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signing protocol. The development repository is at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing.\r\n\r\nThere already exists [RFC 9591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9591.html), which standardizes the two-round FROST signing protocol, but it is incompatible with Bitcoin's BIP340 X-only public keys. This BIP bridges that gap by providing a BIP340-compatible variant of FROST.\r\n\r\nThis BIP standardizes the FROST3 variant (Section 2.3 of the [ROAST paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550.pdf)). This variant shares significant similarities with the MuSig2 signing protocol (BIP327). Accordingly, this BIP follows the core design principles of [BIP327](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki), and many sections have been directly adapted from it.\r\n\r\nFROST key generation is out of scope for this BIP. There are sister BIPs such as [ChillDKG](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg) and [Trusted Dealer Generation](https://github.com/BEULAHEVANJALIN/bip-frost-trusted-dealer) that specify key generation mechanisms. This BIP must be used in conjunction with either of those for the full workflow from key generation to signature creation. Careful consideration has been taken to ensure the terminology in this BIP matches that of ChillDKG.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple (experimental) implementations of this specification:\r\n- The reference Python implementation included in this PR\r\n- [secp256k1-zkp FROST module](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/pull/278) (yet to implement the test vectors)\r\n- [FROST-BIP340](https://github.com/jesseposner/FROST-BIP340)\r\n- ~[secp256kfun](https://github.com/LLFourn/secp256kfun/blob/master/schnorr_fun/src/frost/session.rs) (implements ChillDKG with FROST signing)~ TODO: verify if secp256k1fun passes our test vectors\r\n\r\n**Disclosure:** AI has been used to rephrase paragraphs for clarity, refactor certain sections of the reference code, and review pull requests made to the development repository. \r\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated! Please comment on this pull request or open an issue at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing for any feedback. Thank you!\r\n\r\ncc @jonasnick @real-or-random @jesseposner",

      "body": "codex32 string length limited to always cover HRP characters, master seed bit lengths limited to multiples of 32-bits, updated master seed encoding/decoding processes.\r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\n\r\nPR helper for #2040: prepares text for general HRP lengths by defining limits based on string length not data part length and deprecating master seed lengths that violate the new codex32 length rule. \r\n\r\n**Why**\r\nRestricting seeds to 32-bit multiples makes valid secret seed **lengths** differ by at least 6-7 characters reducing ambiguity to two valid lengths for _insert/delete_-correcting error correcting wallets. Restricting to 64-bit multiples has one valid length within correctable distance but @roconnor-blockstream wants 160-bit seeds.\r\n\r\n**Key changes** c286c2c5a7385113d33b3dd8cbda806bd371523f\r\n\r\n- Overall string max length for regular codex32 now limited to 94 chars. Payload changed from “up to 74” → up to 72 bech32 characters. \r\n- Long codex32: new length window (97–1024 characters) and payload allowance relaxed (up to 1001 bech32 chars). \r\n- Explain the checksum covers low HRP+data per BIP-0173.\r\n\r\n**Other changes:**\r\n\r\n- Remove \"decode\" from _Unshared Secret_ as this process should be application specific once HRP is generalized.\r\n- _Master seed format_ changes:\r\n  - Add \"decode\" section.\r\n  - Restrict seed lengths to 32-bit multiples (128-512) to avoid an \"ms\" exception for switching between regular and long format. Leaves our desired **128**-, **160**-, **192**-, 224-, **256**-bitlengths as well as many others.  \r\n  - Recommend how to derive unspecified identifiers for fresh and reshared secret seeds.\r\n  - Recommend deterministic implementations derive padding using a defined CRC code.\r\n- Defined a \"shared string\" as a non-\"0\" threshold parameter codex32 string.\r\n  - Defined how to \"decode\" these as implementers have been surprised naked share payload bytes are insufficient to recover the secret.\r\n- Defined a \"master share set\" as a _k_ shared strings valid set generated with exactly _k_-1 fresh shares in accordance with that section.  (needed for deriving reshare identifiers.) \r\n- Added a couple `<ref>` notes for the less obvious changes. \r\n- Fixed missing `/ref` so _Footnotes_ now appear at the end of _Rationale_ (they're invisible in master)\r\n- Bolded all section references.\r\n\r\n**Backward-compatibility and migration**\r\n- Existing codex32 strings that encode typical data lengths remain valid; however implementations may need to be adjusted that:\r\n  - Accepted codex32 strings 95 and 96 characters long.\r\n  - Rejected Long codex32 data-parts below 81 characters as the new HRP coverage allows them.\r\n  - Rejected codex32 string lengths below 48, equal to 97 or 98 and above 127 characters as codex32 now allows lengths 21 to 94 and 97 to 1024.\r\n\r\n**Test Vectors**\r\nI have a reference implementation with test vectors according to this spec update, as well as #2040, so I will add these if reviewers agree about the text changes.",

      "body": "While reviewing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31247 a while ago I noticed that the mentioned public keys in the PSBT fields of this BIP are quite confusing. This is mostly due to a non-consistent mention of types (plain vs. x-only) and a purpose that is sometimes missing. This PR aims to improve this in the following ways:\r\n- be specific about the purpose of pubkey types in PSBT fields (\"plain pubkey\" alone doesn't say a lot, especially if it's used repeatedly within a field; explicitly call it \"aggregate pubkey\" or \"participant pubkey\" if applicable)\r\n- replace all uses of \"plain pubkey\" by \"compressed pubkey\" (the only category that should matter is whether the pubkey type is \"x-only\" or \"plain\")\r\n- use consistent word order, e.g. prefer \"compressed aggregate public key\" over \"aggregate compressed public key\"\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to even get rid of the \"plain/compressed\" terminology completely. From the fact that \"x-only\" is not explicitly mentioned and the size of 33 bytes it should be obvious that this is a plain public key.",
