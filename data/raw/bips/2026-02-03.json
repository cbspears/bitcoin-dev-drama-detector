      "title": "BIP 89: Chain Code Delegation for Private Collaborative Custody",
      "body": "We propose a new BIP for Chain Code Delegation, a collaborative custody technique that involves privileged participants (delegatee) withholding BIP32 chain codes at key setup time from a delegator, and sharing only enough information for non‑privileged participants to provide their signature.\r\n\r\nFor non-blinded signing, the delegatee derives a per‑spend scalar tweak t from the (withheld) chain code, the delegator computes the child key (x+t, P+tG), and produces a standard signature over the transaction’s sighash. For blind signing, the nonce and challenge are blinded so the delegator returns a blind Schnorr signature that the counterparty unblinds; thanks to Schnorr’s linearity, the same tweak is incorporated without revealing the final message or linkable details (optionally with predicate proofs for policy).\r\n\r\nThis enables participants like collaborative custodians to co‑sign when needed, while avoiding the broad visibility that comes with holding an xpub.\r\n\r\nMore background and discussions can be found: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/chain-code-delegation-private-access-control-for-bitcoin-keys/1837. \r\n\r\nThis is joint work with @jesseposner.

      "title": "BIP445: FROST Signing Protocol for BIP340 Signatures",
      "body": "This PR adds a BIP for the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signing protocol. The development repository is at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing.\r\n\r\nThere already exists [RFC 9591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9591.html), which standardizes the two-round FROST signing protocol, but it is incompatible with Bitcoin's BIP340 X-only public keys. This BIP bridges that gap by providing a BIP340-compatible variant of FROST.\r\n\r\nThis BIP standardizes the FROST3 variant (Section 2.3 of the [ROAST paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550.pdf)). This variant shares significant similarities with the MuSig2 signing protocol (BIP327). Accordingly, this BIP follows the core design principles of [BIP327](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki), and many sections have been directly adapted from it.\r\n\r\nFROST key generation is out of scope for this BIP. There are sister BIPs such as [ChillDKG](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg) and [Trusted Dealer Generation](https://github.com/BEULAHEVANJALIN/bip-frost-trusted-dealer) that specify key generation mechanisms. This BIP must be used in conjunction with either of those for the full workflow from key generation to signature creation. Careful consideration has been taken to ensure the terminology in this BIP matches that of ChillDKG.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple (experimental) implementations of this specification:\r\n- The reference Python implementation included in this PR\r\n- [secp256k1-zkp FROST module](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/pull/278) (yet to implement the test vectors)\r\n- ~[FROST-BIP340](https://github.com/jesseposner/FROST-BIP340)~ TODO: verify if this impl is compatible with our test vectors\r\n- ~[secp256kfun](https://github.com/LLFourn/secp256kfun/blob/master/schnorr_fun/src/frost/session.rs) (implements ChillDKG with FROST signing)~ TODO: verify if this impl is compatible with our test vectors\r\n\r\n**Disclosure:** AI has been used to rephrase paragraphs for clarity, refactor certain sections of the reference code, and review pull requests made to the development repository. \r\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated! Please comment on this pull request or open an issue at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing for any feedback. Thank you!\r\n\r\ncc @jonasnick @real-or-random @jesseposner",

      "body": "Summary:\r\nThis pull request introduces a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for QES2, a hybrid digital signature algorithm that combines post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with traditional ECDSA. The proposal aims to address the potential vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing while preserving backward compatibility with existing Bitcoin infrastructure.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nAbstract: QES2 leverages a dual-signature mechanism to incorporate both a post-quantum signature and a classical ECDSA signature into Bitcoin transactions.\r\n\r\nMotivation: With the emerging threat of quantum computers, classical cryptographic methods may become vulnerable. QES2 presents a transitional solution that enhances security during the shift towards quantum-safe systems.\r\n\r\nSpecification: The BIP outlines the structure, key generation, signing, and verification methods for the hybrid scheme.\r\n\r\nRationale: The hybrid approach ensures that if one signature method is compromised, the other still provides protection, offering a balanced trade-off between security and backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nReference Implementation: A reference implementation will be linked later for further review and testing.",
