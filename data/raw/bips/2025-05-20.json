      "title": "RFC: Integrate secp256k1lab v1.0.0 as subtree, use it for BIP-374",
      "body": "This PR integrates the recently released [secp256k1lab ](https://github.com/secp256k1lab/secp256k1lab) prototyping library as a subtree [1] and uses it in the BIP-374 reference code as a drop-in replacement of the currently used secp256k1.py file (copied in from the Bitcoin Core functional test framework in 0c7e54d780d059ebbab345946d7c6adbc61fef15). This is intended to serve as a showcase in the hope of triggering a discussion with BIP maintainers and authors on how to best integrate current and future BIPs reference implementations that take use secp256k1 curve operations.\r\n\r\nI chose to demo this on BIP-374 since that's the BIP reference implementation I'm most familiar with, and as one can see in the last commit, the interface is fully compatible, i.e. there were no actual changes in the code logic needed. In order to find the vendored copy of secp256k1lab, Python's `sys.path` is extended [2]. Similar integrations have been done in the [bip-frost-dkg](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg) (https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg/pull/83) and [bip-frost-signing](https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing) (https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing/pull/23, still WIP) repos.\r\n\r\nSee also related mailing list threads:\r\n* first mentioning of a secp256k1 prototyping library in the ChillDKG thread: https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/HE3HSnGTpoQ/m/Y2VhaMCrCAAJ (back then it was called \"secp256k1proto\")\r\n* secp256k1lab announcement: https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/f3MQRO-yxEw/m/cEi6Sd7LBwAJ\r\n\r\n[1] added via the command `$ git subtree add --prefix=python/secp256k1lab --squash https://github.com/secp256k1lab/secp256k1lab v1.0.0`\r\n[2] see e.g. https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg/pull/81 for an earlier uglier approach; extending `sys.path` also seems to be a bit hacky, but seems to be the typical way to achieve the goal",

          "body": "Oh, I missed this PR. There's a recent discussion on the specific issue of how to integrate libraries such as secp256k1lab here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2004#issuecomment-3716562747 \r\n\r\nMy suggestion there is that each BIP should vendor its own separate version. Having a single secp256k1lab for the entire bips repo will be problematic for multiple reasons:\r\n - What if authors of multiple BIP want to make modifications to the library code? \r\n - Having an \"official\" subtree makes secp256k1lab special in the BIPs repo. I don't think there's a reason that this library should have a special status, and if anything, it could lead to having two places where the library is maintained. This is bad for the BIP maintainers and for the secp256k1lab maintainers.\r\n - What if a future BIP wants to use a more recent version of secp256k1lab, which is not backward compatible?",

          "body": "@real-or-random @murchandamus: Thanks for the feedback. I agree that vendoring secp256k1lab per BIP makes much more sense. When I opened this PR, I was assuming a single \"set in stone\" version would be sufficient and secp256k1lab would likely remain backwards-compatible indefinitely (i.e. a subtree bump would never be problematic), but that assumption seems a bit far-fetched -- especially with BIP-specific modifications. Closing this PR, will take a look at #2070 soon.",
