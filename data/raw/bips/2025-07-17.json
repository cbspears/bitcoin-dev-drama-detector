      "title": "BIP119: Fix plotting of pending transactions for congestion control rates",
      "body": "Correct the assignment of variables when plotting \"Confirmed but Pending Transactions\" in the simulation. Now, the 1x rate line uses blocktimes_c1 and unspendable, and the 2x rate line uses blocktimes_c2 and unspendable2, ensuring the graph labels and data match correctly. This improves the accuracy and clarity of the simulation results visualization.",
