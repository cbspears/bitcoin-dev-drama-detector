      "body": "made a few tweaks to make the script behave better:\r\n\r\n* turned on `shopt -s nullglob` so the loop skips `*.mediawiki` when there are no files.\r\n* put quotes around `$fname` in `grep` so filenames with spaces don’t break things.\r\n* switched `if [ \"$GRES\" != \"\" ]` to `if [ -n \"$GRES\" ]` — just cleaner and more reliable.",
