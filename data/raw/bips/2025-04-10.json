      "title": "BIP-0374: fix incorrect bit index and modernize CSV reader usage in test vector scripts",
      "body": "- **Corrected a logic bug in `gen_test_vectors.py`**  \r\n  Previously, the message tampering logic mistakenly used the proof damage index (`proof_damage_pos`) instead of the correct message index (`msg_damage_pos`). This could result in ineffective or misleading bit-flip tests.  \r\n  Now fixed to use the correct index for tampering the message.\r\n\r\n- **Modernized usage of `csv.reader` in `run_test_vectors.py`**  \r\n  Replaced the outdated `reader.__next__()` with the idiomatic and Python 3–safe `next(reader)` call for skipping headers.\r\n",

Note though that we also track the generated test vectors data, so you should run the fixed `gen_test_vectors.py` script and include the re-generated .csv files in the commit.",
