      "title": "BIP174: Specify PSBT_IN_PREVIOUS_TXID serialization order",
      "body": "This change updates descriptions for the `PSBT_IN_PREVIOUS_TXID` field to specify serialization order.\r\n\r\nIt was not straightforward the order with which to store the txid in a psbt. It's not clearly specified in the spec, and there are not many resources or parsers to aid in debugging PSBTv2. I found the BIP370 test vector \"Case: PSBTv0 but with PSBT_IN_PREVIOUS_TXID.\" seems to imply that the order of this txid value in `PSBT_IN_PREVIOUS_TXID` should match network serialization order.\r\n\r\nI'm torn on if \"little endian\" is the correct phrase to use here in conjunction with \"txid\". I usually think of a \"txid\" as the big endian, human-presented order of a txn hash, but maybe it's okay to use interchangeably. ",
