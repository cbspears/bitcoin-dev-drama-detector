          "body": "> supporting different curves could mean completely different curve parameters (e.g. different constants a, b, p, n etc., and even different serialization size of scalars and points that are not compatible with the BIP)\r\n\r\nIndeed, from what I see the constant `n` is used in the BIP directly, `p` is used indirectly for `cbytes(P)`->`xbytes(P)`->`x(P)`, and the serialization sizes could be larger than 32 bytes. I *think* these are the only items in the BIP that would have to be changed for other curves. It seems like adapting this would be straightforward though, unlike BIP327. We could simply say `p` is the field size and `n` is the order, and `xbytes` should use a length greater than 32 if required by the curve.",
