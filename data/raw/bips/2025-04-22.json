So, what you're saying take Group 1 out as it covered in your BIP-360 and just foucs on Group 2 algorithms for communications between nodes, and wallets.  It makes sense but let me tell the following:\n\n1.  Main objective of pqcBitcoin was a holistic implementation pqc repo.\n\n2.  If we go this suggestion, we need to know how to integrate your BIP-360 (seems Group 1) and Group 2.",

Try putting yourself in the shoes of someone reading your document without prior knowledge. What do they want to learn from your document? What questions would they have?
