      "title": "Draft BIP: Block Size Reduction for Spam Mitigation",
      "body": "## Summary\n\nThis draft BIP proposes reducing the maximum block size from 4MB (weight) to 2MB (weight) to mitigate transaction spam and blockchain bloat.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal aims to:\n- Limit blockchain growth rate\n- Reduce resource requirements for running full nodes\n- Prioritize financial transactions over data storage use cases\n- Improve network decentralization\n\n## Status\n\nThis is an early draft seeking community feedback. As per BIP-02, this should be discussed on the Bitcoin development mailing list before formal consideration.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This is a **hard fork** proposal requiring overwhelming economic consensus\n- Reduces maximum block weight from 4,000,000 to 2,000,000\n- Requires extensive community discussion before any deployment consideration\n- May be controversial and requires careful consideration of tradeoffs\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Community review and feedback\n2. Discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list\n3. Refinement based on technical and economic analysis\n4. Further development if there is interest\n\n---\n\nPlease note: This is submitted as a draft to initiate discussion. The author understands that significant community consensus building would be required before any such change could be considered for activation.",

      "title": "fix: correct misleading ORDER_HALF comment in bip-0374",
      "body": "The comment for ORDER_HALF incorrectly stated it represents \"Number of valid distinct x coordinates on the curve\". This is wrong - ORDER_HALF is simply half the group order, commonly used for ECDSA low-S signature normalization. The number of valid x coordinates on secp256k1 is approximately (p-1)/2 where p is the field size, which is a completely different value.\r\n\r\nAlso clarified the ORDER comment from \"plus 1 for infinity\" to \"including infinity\" for better accuracy.",
