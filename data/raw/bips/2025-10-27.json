It took a day or so for the mods to approve me to post on the ML, then another day or so for them to approve my actual BIP announcement. During this time I had to repeatedly submit subscription requests and the announcement email, because there is not really clear feedback about whether the request succeeded.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure, but just in case, I also recommend not using an @proton.me address, as this appears to trigger Google's defenses.\r\n\r\nThis was the cause for the delay.",

The idea here is to clarify that the required discussion be in its own dedicated thread, rather than a possibly tangential comment in a different thread, to give the idea sufficient exposure and discussion.\r\n\r\n(Yes, best to hold off on opening a PR until after a discussion on the mail list.)",
