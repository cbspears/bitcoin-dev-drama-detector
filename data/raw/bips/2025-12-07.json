The value of the BIPs repository will live and die how on accurately it reflects the needs of the developers working on bitcoin and what they commonly reference. The mailing list cannot be a \"required\" part of the process ( what if the mailing list didn't exist? it's just a bad idea). I really don't think of any of this as policy, as you cannot force anyone to do anything with any BIP (including any BIP editors), but rather it's an exercise of writing down expectations.",
