It was also suggested fairly early on to push to the repo directly. This worked fine until recently, but given recent events, I think it is best to clarify in BIP 3 at what moment a number is assigned, and IMO that moment should be publicly on the PR, like BIP 2, as proposed here and as I think we generally see it.",

OTOH, it hasn't been the practice recently since the de facto requirement for a PR, so maybe it's fine. But in that case, Rationale should probably mention/justify it.\r\n\r\nThis practice appears to have led to several number assignments to ideas that never substantiated into written documents. It’s not clear to me why it would ever be necessary or advantageous to assign a number privately.\r\nBoth BIP 2 and BIP 3 describe that a number assignment follows a properly formatted, high quality draft being submitted per a pull request, so it’s not undue to expect that a pull request exists at the time of a number assignment, and the corresponding pull request is obviously the appropriate place to announce the assignment (even explicitly stated in BIP 2).",
