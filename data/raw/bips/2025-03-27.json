      "title": "BIP380: make specs consistent about hardened indicators",
      "body": "Me and my students noticed a discrepancy in the test vectors and specification regarding the allowed characters denoting hardened nodes. The [BIP380](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0380.mediawiki) specs allows all three `h`, `'` and `H`, in particular the specs read:\r\n\r\n> In the above specification, the hardened indicator `h` may be replaced with alternative \r\nhardened indicators of `H` or `'`.\r\n\r\nHowever, the following is then an **invalid** test vectors:\r\n\r\n> [deadbeef/0H/0H/0H]0260b2003c386519fc9eadf2b5cf124dd8eea4c4e68d5e154050a9346ea98ce600\r\n\r\nThus, I've added new test vectors allowing `H` and removed the inconsistent one. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am far from claiming that this is the **correct** way how to handle this. I've checked that [people](https://github.com/search?q=%2F%28%3F-i%290H%5C%2F0H%5C%2F%2F&type=code) are using the `H`, but I got no (meaningful or relevant) hits when searching for the exact test vector. I didn't see the option to create issues, thus I've continued by proposing the, what _seems_ to be, reasonable changes.",

Prior to creating the PR I've checked the [Contribution guidelines](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), but that didn't answer the question, whether such a PR would be appreciated. Since asking in an issue is not an option, I just created the PR and let the maintainers decide. There is a [list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+typo) of sometimes single character typo fix PRs, I believe(d) this one fits in.",
