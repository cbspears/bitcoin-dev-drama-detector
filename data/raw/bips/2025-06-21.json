Have you coordinated with the owners of this BIP on the deployment mechanism for this soft fork? Do you intend to work on getting BIP 118 deployed and filling in all these TBDs?",

The actual deployment parameters (bit numbers, timing, etc.) would still need to be decided by Core devs and the community if/when this gets seriously considered for activation.\r\n\r\nBasically just trying to make the BIP more complete by having a proper deployment spec instead of just \"TODO\". The TBD values would get filled in during the real deployment process. Haven't coordinated with the BIP authors yet - figured I'd start with the PR and see if this direction makes sense.",

I hesitate between suggesting this be closed, or waiting until, say, the end of July for approval and if none then closing.",
