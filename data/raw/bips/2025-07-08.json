          "body": "> I would propose to cherry-pick this commit into #1820, if that’s okay for you, because the Version field doesn’t exist in the BIP 2 process, and we will need to allow it when BIP 3 becomes active. Alternatively, we could merge your PR alongside #1820, when BIP 3 is activated.\r\n\r\nSure, I would prefer whatever minimizes hassle for BIP editors, so sounds like cherry-picking into 1820 and removing the version field from 1890 for now makes the most sense, but I defer to your judgement\r\n",
