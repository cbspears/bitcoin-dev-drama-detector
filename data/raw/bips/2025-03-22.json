      "title": "BIP 345: Fix OP_VAULT_RECOVER specification for the recovery-sPK-hash",
      "body": "The recovery scriptPubKey needs to be prefixed with its CompactSize-encoded length when computing the sPK hash.\r\n\r\nI verified this by:\r\n- Checking the [functional tests](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/commit/5e59c074703f0913db7ee004b99d086857d10ad6#diff-65a47d52759ba7800338bacb3005836bdc0f3962de356621e5c50887c85c4af8R1407-R1409), where `recovery_spk_tagged_hash()` is implemented using [`ser_string()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/af3dee0b8d456a8aa9ade9c6e7f4283a90590eae/test/functional/test_framework/messages.py#L148-L149) which adds the CompactSize-encoded length prefix\r\n- Using an [implementation in Minsc](https://min.sc/v0.3/#gist=d8ac58dadc7377c3e231b4c7735ee5c5) to construct a [transaction](https://mutinynet.com/tx/944db06a37842fea9f7db117a0118221ee4bbdb0116354c562adcd12edaa365e) spending using `OP_VAULT_RECOVER` and broadcasting it to mutinynet (see line 2 for the recovery sPK hash computation)\r\n- Checking with @jamesob \r\n\r\nAlternatively, the implementation could be amended to match the current specification and drop the length prefix. Since this is committing to a single element, the length isn't really necessary.",

      "body": "This pull request refactors the logical checks in `reference.py` to enhance code readability and follow best practices in Python. Specifically:\r\n- Replaced bitwise `&` with logical `and` in conditional checks.\r\n- Simplified list length checks by using Pythonic `if input_pub_keys:` instead of `if len(input_pub_keys) > 0`.\r\n\r\nThese changes improve the clarity and consistency of the code while maintaining its functionality.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Replaced `&` with `and` for logical operations in several conditional checks.\r\n- Replaced `if len(input_pub_keys) > 0` with `if input_pub_keys` to check for non-empty lists.\r\n",
