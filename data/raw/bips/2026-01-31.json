      "title": "BIP445: FROST Signing Protocol for BIP340 Signatures",
      "body": "This PR adds a BIP for the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signing protocol. The development repository is at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing.\r\n\r\nThere already exists [RFC 9591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9591.html), which standardizes the two-round FROST signing protocol, but it is incompatible with Bitcoin's BIP340 X-only public keys. This BIP bridges that gap by providing a BIP340-compatible variant of FROST.\r\n\r\nThis BIP standardizes the FROST3 variant (Section 2.3 of the [ROAST paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550.pdf)). This variant shares significant similarities with the MuSig2 signing protocol (BIP327). Accordingly, this BIP follows the core design principles of [BIP327](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki), and many sections have been directly adapted from it.\r\n\r\nFROST key generation is out of scope for this BIP. There are sister BIPs such as [ChillDKG](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg) and [Trusted Dealer Generation](https://github.com/BEULAHEVANJALIN/bip-frost-trusted-dealer) that specify key generation mechanisms. This BIP must be used in conjunction with either of those for the full workflow from key generation to signature creation. Careful consideration has been taken to ensure the terminology in this BIP matches that of ChillDKG.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple (experimental) implementations of this specification:\r\n- The reference Python implementation included in this PR\r\n- [secp256k1-zkp FROST module](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/pull/278) (yet to implement the test vectors)\r\n- ~[FROST-BIP340](https://github.com/jesseposner/FROST-BIP340)~ TODO: verify if this impl is compatible with our test vectors\r\n- ~[secp256kfun](https://github.com/LLFourn/secp256kfun/blob/master/schnorr_fun/src/frost/session.rs) (implements ChillDKG with FROST signing)~ TODO: verify if this impl is compatible with our test vectors\r\n\r\n**Disclosure:** AI has been used to rephrase paragraphs for clarity, refactor certain sections of the reference code, and review pull requests made to the development repository. \r\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated! Please comment on this pull request or open an issue at https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing for any feedback. Thank you!\r\n\r\ncc @jonasnick @real-or-random @jesseposner",

The proposal aims to address the potential vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing while preserving backward compatibility with existing Bitcoin infrastructure.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nAbstract: QES2 leverages a dual-signature mechanism to incorporate both a post-quantum signature and a classical ECDSA signature into Bitcoin transactions.\r\n\r\nMotivation: With the emerging threat of quantum computers, classical cryptographic methods may become vulnerable. QES2 presents a transitional solution that enhances security during the shift towards quantum-safe systems.\r\n\r\nSpecification: The BIP outlines the structure, key generation, signing, and verification methods for the hybrid scheme.\r\n\r\nRationale: The hybrid approach ensures that if one signature method is compromised, the other still provides protection, offering a balanced trade-off between security and backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nReference Implementation: A reference implementation will be linked later for further review and testing.",

      "body": "At some point[ github changed how anchor links](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker/issues/229#issuecomment-1418272363) work. Currently anchor links using the double square bracket format require that the anchor be prepended with `user-content-`.\r\n\r\nThis means that the following link used to work, but doesn't today\r\n\r\n```\r\n [[bip-0341.mediawiki#design|BIP341]]\r\n```\r\n \r\nThe link that works today would be\r\n \r\n```\r\n[[bip-0341.mediawiki#user-content-design|BIP341]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe link still resolves to the page, but just not the anchor so I suspect no one noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to this it appears that in the past github anchors could have spaces or punction, but that is no longer valid. Spaces are replaced with `_` and punction appears to be not included in the anchor.\r\n\r\nI fixed this for BIP 0342, BIP 0022, BIP 0023, but it impacts a good chunk of BIPs. If you want I can change this PR to fix for all the BIPs, but I didn't want to put in the time to do that in case an editor wanted to make these changes themselves.\r\n\r\nIf this PR isn't useful or the project isn't interested in fixing this very minor linking issue. Feel free to close this PR.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "codex32 string length limited to always cover HRP characters, master seed bit lengths limited to multiples of 32-bits, updated master seed encoding/decoding processes.\r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\n\r\nPR helper for #2040: prepares text for general HRP lengths by defining limits based on string length not data part length and deprecating master seed lengths that violate the new codex32 length rule. \r\n\r\n**Why**\r\nRestricting seeds to 32-bit multiples makes valid secret seed **lengths** differ by at least 6-7 characters reducing ambiguity to two valid lengths for _insert/delete_-correcting error correcting wallets. Restricting to 64-bit multiples has one valid length within correctable distance but @roconnor-blockstream wants 160-bit seeds.\r\n\r\n**Key changes** c286c2c5a7385113d33b3dd8cbda806bd371523f\r\n\r\n- Overall string max length for regular codex32 now limited to 94 chars. Payload changed from “up to 74” → up to 72 bech32 characters. \r\n- Long codex32: new length window (97–1024 characters) and payload allowance relaxed (up to 1001 bech32 chars). \r\n- Explain the checksum covers low HRP+data per BIP-0173.\r\n\r\n**Other changes:**\r\n\r\n- Remove \"decode\" from _Unshared Secret_ as this process should be application specific once HRP is generalized.\r\n- _Master seed format_ changes:\r\n  - Add \"decode\" section.\r\n  - Restrict seed lengths to 32-bit multiples (128-512) to avoid an \"ms\" exception for switching between regular and long format. Leaves our desired **128**-, **160**-, **192**-, 224-, **256**-bitlengths as well as many others.  \r\n  - Recommend how to derive unspecified identifiers for fresh and reshared secret seeds.\r\n  - Recommend deterministic implementations derive padding using a defined CRC code.\r\n- Defined a \"shared string\" as a non-\"0\" threshold parameter codex32 string.\r\n  - Defined how to \"decode\" these as implementers have been surprised naked share payload bytes are insufficient to recover the secret.\r\n- Defined a \"master share set\" as a _k_ shared strings valid set generated with exactly _k_-1 fresh shares in accordance with that section.  (needed for deriving reshare identifiers.) \r\n- Added a couple `<ref>` notes for the less obvious changes. \r\n- Fixed missing `/ref` so _Footnotes_ now appear at the end of _Rationale_ (they're invisible in master)\r\n- Bolded all section references.\r\n\r\n**Backward-compatibility and migration**\r\n- Existing codex32 strings that encode typical data lengths remain valid; however implementations may need to be adjusted that:\r\n  - Accepted codex32 strings 95 and 96 characters long.\r\n  - Rejected Long codex32 data-parts below 81 characters as the new HRP coverage allows them.\r\n  - Rejected codex32 string lengths below 48, equal to 97 or 98 and above 127 characters as codex32 now allows lengths 21 to 94 and 97 to 1024.\r\n\r\n**Test Vectors**\r\nI have a reference implementation with test vectors according to this spec update, as well as #2040, so I will add these if reviewers agree about the text changes.",
