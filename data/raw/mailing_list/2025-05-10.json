We are contemplating a \"consensus bug\" that would cause a chain split because the BIP30 exceptions are no longer being covered by any checkpoint. The heights at which this would cause a split are well below all but 3 of the 14 checkpoints. For that to occur 11 formerly checkpointed blocks would first have to be popped, given the existence of a stronger chain capable of triggering the above bug. This implies 11 more chain splits, depending at which point nodes adopted the checkpoint soft fork(s), just to reach this bug, and up to 14 possible in total. It makes no sense to fix this bug without first fixing chain splits that would be triggered *over 200,000 blocks less deep* than this BIP30 bug. And the only way to fix those is to not remove the checkpoints - which renders this bug inert.\n\n> I'm agnostic about whether having\n> checkpoints is also a reason to forgo consensus checks such as BIP30 (or my\n> proposed alternative of checking the coinbase TXID for uniqueness and\n> ensuring no future collision).\n\nThere is certainly a reason, the checkpoints are consensus rules.\n\n> Even though checkpoints essentially force your node to halt if something were invalid up until that point, \n\nRight, if any other rule conflicted with them then the chain would stall forever at that point. That is not the applied meaning of these rules. The checkpoints declare that the blocks are required and therefore inherently valid. The reason we are having this conversation is the contemplated removal of the checkpoints, which also implies that other validation within covered blocks is not consensus.\n\n> I still think there is value in being able to verify that the rules were followed.\n\nLike them or not, checkpoints are the rules that are required to be",

The idea of delegating one’s coins is not a new one. Some \nspeculate <https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/op_codeseparator/> that OP_\nCODESEPARATOR was an early attempt by Satoshi to do delegation. More \nrecently, proposals like Graftroot \n<https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CAAS2fgSnfd++94+40vnSRxQfi9fk8N6+2-DbjVpssHxFvYveFQ@mail.gmail.com/>\n and Entroot <https://gist.github.com/sipa/ca1502f8465d0d5032d9dd2465f32603>\n have been put forward, which would enable delegation (and re-delegation), \nbut only from key path spends and only to a locking script. In contrast, \nCSFS <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0348.md> would enable \ndelegation from script path spends, but it's limited, as it only \nfacilitates delegation within a pre-committed script.\n\nWhen considering delegation, what type of functionality is desirable? I’d \nargue that generalized delegation has two properties:\n\n   1. Delegation *from any valid spending path*\n   2. Delegation *to arbitrarily complex compositions of programs and \n   script*\n\nThe latter is important so that users can delegate to *addresses*, and not \njust public keys, while retaining the ability to add timelocks and other \nconditions.\n\nIn order to build this, we need two key features: 1) \"Generalized \nComposition,\" and 2) \"Generalized Delegation.\" Generalized composition \ninvolves the conjunction of programs and script, and delegation is merely \nthe addition of a second composition on-the-fly, if the primary one is \nsatisfied.\n\nIs there a simple and safe way to implement generalized composition and \ndelegation within Taproot? I think there is...\n\nI’d like to present a proof-of-concept that I came up with, wh",

          "body": "[-- Attachment #1: Type: text/plain, Size: 3481 bytes --]\n\nHi everyone,\n\nSwiftSync is a new validation method that allows for near-stateless, fully\nparallelizable validation of the Bitcoin blockchain via hints about which\noutputs remain unspent (<100MB total). All other inputs/outputs are\nefficiently crossed off inside a single hash aggregate that only reaches\nzero if validation was successful and the hints were correct.\n\nThe main observation is that it can be much easier to validate that a given\nUTXO set is correct than to compute it yourself. It allows us to no longer\nrequire a stateful moment-to-moment UTXO set during IBD and allows\neverything to be order independent. I'll briefly summarize the protocol,\nbefore sharing the link to the full write-up.\n\nEach output gets a boolean hint (e.g. committed into Bitcoin Core) about\nwhether or not it will still be in the UTXO set after validation completes.\nIf it does, we write it to disk (append-only - it won't be used until\nSwiftSync finishes). If it does not, we hash the UTXO data and add it to an\naggregate. For each input, we once again hash the UTXO data and remove it\nfrom the aggregate.\n\nAt the end, for every added output there should have been exactly one\nremoved input, bringing the end total of the aggregate to zero. If this is\nindeed the case, we will have validated that the hints, and the resulting\nUTXO set, were correct.\n\nE.g. For spent outputs A, B and inputs C, D we calculate hash(UTXO_A||salt)\n+ hash(UTXO_B||salt) - hash(UTXO_C||salt) - hash(UTXO_D||salt) == 0\n(proving (A==C && B==D) || (A==D && B==C)).\n\nThere is one missing step. The UTXO data is only available when processing\nthe output, but not when processing the input. We resolve this by either\ndownloading the outputs that were spent for each block (equivalent to the\nundo data, maybe 10-15% of a block), or we lean on assumevalid, making it\nsufficient to only hash the outpoints (which are available in both the\noutput and input) rather than the full UTXO da",

Obviously CTR mode would be unsuitable! (I mean sure modular add/sub and xor are different operations but they are quite close).

I said (in the BIP30 thread):\n\n> One reference states that “assume valid” speeds IBD, but of course it does so by not validating.\n\nWhich was in response to your OP of this thread, which provided that reference, specifically:\n\n\"Assumed Valid Blocks: a feature designed to replace the secondary use of checkpoints for (optionally) speeding up Initial Block Download (IBD) by skipping validation of signatures in old blocks. This was deployed in Bitcoin Core 0.14\" - David A. Harding\n\nThis in turn references the following discussion:\n\n\"Bitcoin 0.5.0 built upon those checkpoints to speed up IBD by skipping verification of signatures in blocks that were earlier in the block chain than the most recent checkpoint.\"\n\nhttps://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/08/release-0.14.0/#assumed-valid-blocks\n\n> >  The top checkpoint is consensus for over 11 years and materially reduces\n> the validation cost of 295,000 blocks.\n> \n> I don't think performance should be a consideration when removing\n> checkpoints.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, I am not arguing against this hard fork because it reduces IBD cost. I’m pointing out that one of the arguments *in favor* of removing checkpoints is that \"assume valid\" now serves this \"secondary use\". However, as I pointed out, assume valid is not consensus, it achieves this outcome by trusting, not validating. The existing checkpoints are consensus - they provide this advantage when fully validating.\n\nI'm not suggesting that checkpoints need to be added to improve performance. I'm pointing out that removing them hurts performance. So performance is obviously not a reason to accept such a hard fork.\n\n> Afaik checkpoints were not introduced as a performance feature, but rather as\n> a DoS vulnerability fix.\n\nIt appears from the above discussion that there was more than one reason. However this isn't relevant. What matters is the consequences of ",

Tim Ruffing, Yannick\nSeurin and I recently published DahLIAS, the first interactive aggregate\nsignature scheme with constant-size signatures (64 bytes) compatible with\nsecp256k1.\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2025/692.pdf\n\nRecall that in an aggregate signature scheme, each signer contributes their own\nmessage, which distinguishes it from multi- and threshold signatures, where all\nsigners sign the same message. This makes aggregate signature schemes the\nnatural cryptographic primitive for cross-input signature aggregation because\neach transaction input typically requires signing a different message.\n\nPrevious candidates for constant-size aggregate signatures either:\n- Required cryptographic assumptions quite different from the discrete logarithm\n   problem on secp256k1 currently used in Bitcoin signatures (e.g., groups with\n   efficient pairings).\n- Were \"folklore\" constructions, lacking detailed descriptions and security\n   proofs.\n\nBesides presenting DahLIAS, the paper provides a proof that a class of these\nfolklore constructions are indeed secure if the signer does _not_ use key\ntweaking (e.g., no Taproot commitments or BIP 32 derivation). Moreover, we show\nthat there exists a concrete attack against a folklore aggregate signature\nscheme derived from MuSig2 when key tweaking is used.\n\nIn contrast, DahLIAS is proven to be compatible with key tweaking. Moreover, it\nrequires two rounds of communication for signing, where the first round can be\nrun before the messages to be signed are known. Verification of DahLIAS\nsignatures is asymptotically twice as fast as half-aggregate Schnorr signatures\nand as batch verification of individual Schnorr signatures.\n\nWe believe DahLIAS offers an attractive building block for a potential CISA\nproposal and welcome any feedback or discussion.\n\nJonas Nick, Tim Ruffing, Yannick Seurin\n\n\n[0] See, e.",

But I think that's fine.\n\nYes, I agree. I believe there is one more thing to falicitate any future\npotential encoding scheme transition for application.\n\nI.e you have the 1-byte : 0x00 | <random_payload_data>, and you could\nhave a an application-only versioning of the <random_payload_data> with\none more 1-byte, to give the evolvability to application to experiment\nwith multiple parsing format.\n\nSo you would have \"1-byte\" 0x00 | \"random_payload_data\" where \n\"random_payload_data\"\nis defined as 1-byte: <version_number> | \"random_payload_data\". That\nversion number shall only have application meaning, no consensus, it's\njust some kind of clear domain separation. AFAICT, the version number\ncould be always retrofitted for a non-0x00 tag-length-value consensus\nmeaning.\n\nIf it can be useful in any way, an old annex branch with a try of TLV:\nhttps://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/commit/84a897feb20c7df813e236d6bf98b69e241a4530\n\nIMHO, this was a very positive thing for taproot to have a lot of\nversioning and upgradeability paths (e.g leaves version, pubkey type, etc).\n\n> There is a possibility of a multi-party, annex-using, protocol where\n> someone does a pinning attack by re-signing their transaction with a\n> bigger annex.

Because then, some \nplanned changes, like entirely dropping the difficulty reset, could be \npotentially turned from hard-fork into just a regular soft-fork, supported \nby hashrate majority.\n\nAnd of course, reorging everything is an edge case, that we may want to see \non any testnet first, before anyone will succeed with that on the main \nnetwork, if SHA-256 will ever be broken, and if re-hashing the whole chain \nwill be needed.\n\nponiedziałek, 31 marca 2025 o 22:41:20 UTC+2 Garlo Nicon napisał(a):\n\n> > 4.

Wait until it has \ncompletely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on \nmacOS)\nor `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL \nis\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be \nmigrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n\nCompatibility\n==============\n\nBitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the\nLinux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+. Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\n\nNotable changes\n===============\n\n### P2P and Network Changes\n\n- Support for UPnP was dropped. If you want to open a port automatically,\n  consider using the `-natpmp` option instead, which uses PCP or NAT-PMP\ndepending on router support. (#31130)\n\n- libnatpmp was replaced with a built-in implementation of PCP and NAT-PMP\n  (still enabled using the `-natpmp` option). This supports automatic IPv4 \nport\nforwarding as well as IPv6 pinholing. (#30043)\n\n- When the `-port` configuration option is used, the default onion listening\n  port will now be derived to be that port + 1 instead of being set to a \nfixed\nvalue (8334 on mainnet).

So sticking to v29 back-ports isn't a long term viable option.\n\n\nI think it's worth considering for the lightning industry to organize a custom signet, either a 1-of-N with keys distributed among the current players, or unsigned proof-of-work based (more hassle, but future new players may feel more comfortable joining). Such a network can be kept online definitely and its replacement can be more easily coordinated. Another advantage is that soft fork proposals can be tested, similar to how Inquisition does that on the default signet, but at a pace that matches Bolt spec work.\n\n- Sjors\n\n> Op 31 mrt 2025, om 23:15 heeft Sanket Kanjalkar <sanket1729@gmail•com> het volgende geschreven:\n> \n> Hi Sjors, \n> Thanks for asking.

I have just assumed that the\nchain cannot be censored profitably if the number of blocks to wait for is\nhigh enough (why: the miners are giving up fees by not including the\ntransaction and the attacker would have to split the reward between all\nminers but the honest user only needs to outbid the attacker once)\n\nThat other idea seems to work even if the chain is censored for arbitrary\nnumber of blocks. In the meantime I was also thinking of a scheme that\nallows you to commit early and then wait for a any time you want but with\nthe ability to detect that someone else is trying to spend it, so that you\ncan act quickly. In some sense it was more similar but still not that good.\nThe proposed scheme with unique decommitment is better and should be\nimplemented instead of my idea.\n\nAnyway, I believe even my weaker idea is still good enough to make my point\ngiven how hard it is to censor a transaction. My point wasn't saying that\nmy specific implementation is the best but saying we can postpone the\ndecision to implement a QR scheme to much later than what some people might\nthink.\n\nHave a nice day!\n\nMartin\n\nDňa ne 30. 3. 2025, 17:41 David A.

Consolidation of inputs\nis often bad for privacy and makes silent payments, coinjoin etc. useless\nin some cases however the user has the choice to select coins manually\nwhile transacting. In payjoin, users can't do much about it.

However, if\nswapped coins are used in transactions, octojoin could be a better solution\nwhich doesn't require any inputs from the recipient.\n\n> I'm not sure what you mean by \"the recipient would never doubt it\n> because it's a privacy tool\", it sounds to me like this is mainly a\n> criticism of the UX of payjoin supporting wallets, or of wallets in\n> general for not educating users that privacy is not a binary thing?\n\nThe recipient would never doubt a sender who insists on using payjoin and\nnot interested in a normal bitcoin transaction. They would not know the\nintentions of the sender before payjoin.\n\n> Note that in all of these specifications of payjoin UTXO probing is\n> not costless since the sender must send a fully signed transaction in\n> order to learn such a UTXO, and this transaction although not\n> confirmed still imposes a fee cost on the sender if broadcast (even if\n> it is replaced).\n\nIt was costless in the demo which could be fixed by bullbitcoin.

This prevents the attacker from\ndetecting with certainty the next payjoin of the merchant to another peer.\"\n\n> One other important thing that is discussed  in BIP78, there is a\ndifference between a \"merchant\" (or in any case, payment-receiving-server)\ncase vs. a peer to peer payments case. In the latter case you cannot simply\ncontinuously ask for more and more \"invoices\" (payjoin urls) from the\ncounterparty.\n\nAn attacker could use social engineering and ask for multiple payjoin URI\nor use different nyms.
