As far as I'm aware it's never been done before on any network. \n\nKeep in mind that testnet-specific code has to live right next to, even inside of, mainnet consensus code. We want the change to be as simple as possible, so as to not accidentally break mainnet.\n\nUnless and until coin expiration is something we're seriously considering for mainnet, we'd rather not implement it for testnet.\n\nThis particular idea probably requires a lot of changes all over the place (consensus, mempool, wallet) because it breaks the assumption that coins don't expire.\n\n\nSomething I've proposed in person a few times, is to double the coins every halving. In terms of code, it boils down to changing GetBlockSubsidy:\n\nCAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;\n// Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.\nIf (consensusParams.inflation) {\n    // Except on testnet5\n    nSubsidy <<= halvings;\n} else {\n  nSubsidy >>= halvings;\n}\n\nThis will eventually overflow, but that seems fine for a testnet. Along with the timewarp fix, the network might even grind to a halt in 2106, long before we overflow 64 bit numbers.\n\nRust Bitcoin [0] currently refuses amounts above 21 million BTC, but they would have many years to fix that.\n\n\nStrong inflation has been battle tested by governments around the world for millennia as a way to discourage saving.\n\n- Sjors\n\n[0] https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/issues/4273\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/8E819BCF-EEAE-4F10-89A1-FA3FDE0F67E3%40sprovoost.nl.",

Non-upgraded clients could then still see \nsome CPU-mined blocks, but they will disappear, if the hashrate majority \nwill support your changes, and then old clients will automatically follow \nyour chain.

          "body": "Dear list,\n\nI thought this was already communicated, but I can't find a thread.\n\nA recent pull request was merged into Bitcoin Core that removes existing checkpoints and all related support code.[0] The current plan is for this change to be part of v30 which should be released this fall.\n\nCheckpoints are no longer needed in order to protect against low proof-of-work header spam attacks, thanks to the headers pre-sync functionality included since v24. [1]\n\nThe existing checkpoints no longer provide enough security against those attacks. Adding new checkpoints is not desirable.\n\nHowever, if someone is aware of another attack, please disclose it (ideally responsibly) so the change can be reverted. [2]\n\nSince older versions of Bitcoin Core, as well as other Bitcoin implementations, still enforce the checkpoints, an extremely large reorg (attack by aliens, NSA, etc) would split the network. This may already be the case due to the way some older soft forks have been grandfathered / buried in Bitcoin Core.[3]\n\nI think many would consider Bitcoin a total loss in such a scenario and not worth salvaging - especially if the attacker didn't airdrop you any coins in the reorg. But it could be useful for someone to write a BIP that describes what happens in such a scenario. It could recommend ways to at least regain consistency, and perhaps permanently apply some soft fork rules from genesis (e.g. activate them if the last checkpoint header is absent).\n\nKind regards,\n\nSjors Provoost\n\n[0] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31649\n[1] https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/121235/4948\n[2] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/SECURITY.md\n[3] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0090.mediawiki\n\n\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion vi",

Tim Ruffing, Yannick\nSeurin and I recently published DahLIAS, the first interactive aggregate\nsignature scheme with constant-size signatures (64 bytes) compatible with\nsecp256k1.\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2025/692.pdf\n\nRecall that in an aggregate signature scheme, each signer contributes their own\nmessage, which distinguishes it from multi- and threshold signatures, where all\nsigners sign the same message. This makes aggregate signature schemes the\nnatural cryptographic primitive for cross-input signature aggregation because\neach transaction input typically requires signing a different message.\n\nPrevious candidates for constant-size aggregate signatures either:\n- Required cryptographic assumptions quite different from the discrete logarithm\n   problem on secp256k1 currently used in Bitcoin signatures (e.g., groups with\n   efficient pairings).\n- Were \"folklore\" constructions, lacking detailed descriptions and security\n   proofs.\n\nBesides presenting DahLIAS, the paper provides a proof that a class of these\nfolklore constructions are indeed secure if the signer does _not_ use key\ntweaking (e.g., no Taproot commitments or BIP 32 derivation). Moreover, we show\nthat there exists a concrete attack against a folklore aggregate signature\nscheme derived from MuSig2 when key tweaking is used.\n\nIn contrast, DahLIAS is proven to be compatible with key tweaking. Moreover, it\nrequires two rounds of communication for signing, where the first round can be\nrun before the messages to be signed are known. Verification of DahLIAS\nsignatures is asymptotically twice as fast as half-aggregate Schnorr signatures\nand as batch verification of individual Schnorr signatures.\n\nWe believe DahLIAS offers an attractive building block for a potential CISA\nproposal and welcome any feedback or discussion.\n\nJonas Nick, Tim Ruffing, Yannick Seurin\n\n\n[0] See, e.",

Wait until it has \ncompletely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on \nmacOS)\nor `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL \nis\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be \nmigrated.

Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.

This supports automatic IPv4 \nport\nforwarding as well as IPv6 pinholing. (#30043)\n\n- When the `-port` configuration option is used, the default onion listening\n  port will now be derived to be that port + 1 instead of being set to a \nfixed\nvalue (8334 on mainnet).

I'm not\npresenting so much a solution as we might want to do this at some\npoint what are problems and can we solve them?\n\n> If it turns out to be the case that PQ schemes need more on-chain size, but have lower per-byte computation cost, a reasonable argument could be made that a higher discount factor for PQ data is acceptable.\n\nI was focused on size because computation is pretty great for most PQ\nsignature schemes. PQ signatures are far cheaper to validate per byte\nand according to BIP-360 Falcon is cheaper than edDSA per signature\nverification.\n\nEdDSA Cycles to verify: 130,000\nFALCON-512 Cycles to verify: 81,036\n\nThis is one of the reasons I am very optimistic that Bitcoin will move\nto post-quantum signatures. If research shows that these signature\nschemes are sufficiently JPEG resistant, and I think it will, then a\ndiscount is very attractive.\n\n> I don't think pre-aggregation (beyond a single-transaction-wide one) is realistic, as it effectively breaks in-mempool transaction replacement, turning every pre-aggregated group of transactions that is being relayed together into an atomic package that must be taken or not as a whole.\n\nIn some circumstances it is possible you could aggregate (P+C1, P+C2)\ninto (P+C1+C2). If you can prove that P is the same in both\ntransactions thus the balance and authentication properties are\nmaintained. However I think what you have described is the shape of\nthe problem we need to solve.\n\nConsider transactions: T1, T1', T2, T3, T4, T5\nwhere T1 and T1' are double spends, i.e., spend the same output to\ndifferent outputs. If half the mempool aggregates TA = (T1, T2, T3)\nand the other half aggregates TB = (T1', T4, T5). TA and TB are\nmutually exclusive and transactions are needlessly dropped on the\nfloor. This is a currently existing griefing vector with coinjoins\ntoday and is an issue with mimblewimble aggregation. I don't think",

I believe there is one more thing to falicitate any future\npotential encoding scheme transition for application.\n\nI.e you have the 1-byte : 0x00 | <random_payload_data>, and you could\nhave a an application-only versioning of the <random_payload_data> with\none more 1-byte, to give the evolvability to application to experiment\nwith multiple parsing format.\n\nSo you would have \"1-byte\" 0x00 | \"random_payload_data\" where \n\"random_payload_data\"\nis defined as 1-byte: <version_number> | \"random_payload_data\". That\nversion number shall only have application meaning, no consensus, it's\njust some kind of clear domain separation.

          "body": "[-- Attachment #1: Type: text/plain, Size: 3481 bytes --]\n\nHi everyone,\n\nSwiftSync is a new validation method that allows for near-stateless, fully\nparallelizable validation of the Bitcoin blockchain via hints about which\noutputs remain unspent (<100MB total). All other inputs/outputs are\nefficiently crossed off inside a single hash aggregate that only reaches\nzero if validation was successful and the hints were correct.\n\nThe main observation is that it can be much easier to validate that a given\nUTXO set is correct than to compute it yourself. It allows us to no longer\nrequire a stateful moment-to-moment UTXO set during IBD and allows\neverything to be order independent. I'll briefly summarize the protocol,\nbefore sharing the link to the full write-up.\n\nEach output gets a boolean hint (e.g. committed into Bitcoin Core) about\nwhether or not it will still be in the UTXO set after validation completes.\nIf it does, we write it to disk (append-only - it won't be used until\nSwiftSync finishes). If it does not, we hash the UTXO data and add it to an\naggregate. For each input, we once again hash the UTXO data and remove it\nfrom the aggregate.\n\nAt the end, for every added output there should have been exactly one\nremoved input, bringing the end total of the aggregate to zero. If this is\nindeed the case, we will have validated that the hints, and the resulting\nUTXO set, were correct.\n\nE.g. For spent outputs A, B and inputs C, D we calculate hash(UTXO_A||salt)\n+ hash(UTXO_B||salt) - hash(UTXO_C||salt) - hash(UTXO_D||salt) == 0\n(proving (A==C && B==D) || (A==D && B==C)).\n\nThere is one missing step. The UTXO data is only available when processing\nthe output, but not when processing the input. We resolve this by either\ndownloading the outputs that were spent for each block (equivalent to the\nundo data, maybe 10-15% of a block), or we lean on assumevalid, making it\nsufficient to only hash the outpoints (which are available in both the\noutput and input) rather than the full UTXO da",

Miners would then monitor these\noutputs and claim them as they become available.\n\nFor example, allow a 1% reward to be spent freely to any address but\nrequire 99% to be sent to an OP_CLTV output timelocked to a\ndeterministically random height between 10-100 years from now.\n\nThe 1% reward could also be required to be sent to a script that enforces a\ntimelock (in addition to other conditions), to avoid flooding the markets\nwith the rewarded coins all at once. Probably a shorter timelock duration\nthough, say picked randomly between 10-30 months.\n\nTo further smooth out variance in the release schedule, coins could be\nsplit into up-to-N-BTC outputs, each staggered with a different\ndeterministic timelock. So for example, a single tx spending 10,000 BTC\nwon't release 9,900 BTC to the miners in a single far-future block (which\nmay cause chain instability if the miners get into a reorg war over it),\nbut rather as 9,900 separate outputs of 1 BTC each released gradually\ntime.[1]\n\nI'm still not sure what I think about this. This is not necessarily an\nendorsement, just a thought. :)\n\n- shesek\n\n[0] OP_CSV only supports relative timelocks of up to 65535 blocks (~15\nmonths), which is too short for that purpose. OP_CLTV supports longer\n(absolute) timelocks.\n\n[1] This can be made more efficient with CTV, by having a single UTXO\ncarrying the full amount that slowly unrolls rather than 9,900 separate\nUTXO entries.\n\n\nOn Sun, Mar 16, 2025 at 5:22 PM Jameson Lopp <jameson.lopp@gmail•com> wrote:\n\n> The quantum computing debat",

          "body": "Slashing covenants is a protocol for covenants in Bitcoin via\nincentives. A covenant is a set of rules about what transactions can\nspend a Bitcoin output which is encumbered by that covenant. Typically\na covenant is enforced by preventing someone from spending that\noutput. In this protocol we instead allow the spending of the output\nand then punish the spender by a loss of funds, i.e. we slash them, if\nthey do not follow the rules of the covenant. This is less secure than\na covenant enforced by an opcode, FE or ColliderScript, because it\nrelies on incentives over enforcement. The advantage of this approach\nis that it is efficient, does not add new cryptographic assumptions\nand is possible on Bitcoin today.\n\nThis protocol uses very similar mechanisms to BitVM, originally I\nthought this was how BitVM worked, which is why I didn’t publish it.\nAfter talking to many people it appears this technique is not used in\nBitVM.\n\n\nNotation\n====\nBy <x>32 we denote a value, x, in Bitcoin Script which is encoded as a\nlist of 32-bit stack elements. We can perform arbitrary computation on\nsuch values using Bitcoin’s math opcodes, a.k.a., Small Script.\n\nProtocol\n====\nThe essential problem for enforcing covenants in Bitcoin outputs is\nshowing that a signature s1 that will pass CHECKSIGVERIFY is equal to\na signature s2 encoded for Small Script. This is because once we get a\nsignature into Small Script, we extract the sighash and do transaction\nintrospection. ColliderScript gets us covenants by using hash\ncollisions to check equality between s1 and <s2>32. CAT gets us\ncovenants by simply concatenating all the <s2>32 and then comparing\nagainst s1 using EQUAL:\n\ns2 = CAT(<s2>32 [0], <s2>32 [1],  <s2>32 [2], … <s2>32 [15])\nEQUAL s1, s2\n\nSlashing covenants works by removing the requirement for this equality\ncheck, but instead providing a fraud proof ifs1!=s2, and posting that\nfraud proof to punish the spending party. To do this we construct a\nBitcoin script output which takes as input:\n\ns1 - t",

          "body": "[-- Attachment #1: Type: text/plain, Size: 21572 bytes --]\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI wanted to kick off a discussion on how the Quantum-Resistant Address\nMigration Protocol (QRAMP), could integrate smoothly with the existing\nBIP-360 (Pay to Quantum Resistant Hash) proposal. Both of these proposals\naim to protect Bitcoin from potential quantum computing threats, but they\napproach the problem from slightly different angles. I believe they could\ncomplement each other nicely.\n\nThe QRAMP proposal introduces a mandatory migration period after which\nspending from legacy ECDSA-based addresses becomes invalid. The goal is to\npush users proactively towards quantum-resistant addresses, ensuring older,\npotentially vulnerable public keys are phased out before quantum computing\nposes a real threat.\n\nMeanwhile, BIP-360 defines a new quantum-resistant address format and\nassociated transaction validation rules. It introduces hash-based and\nhybrid post-quantum signatures, designed specifically to integrate smoothly\nwith Bitcoin’s current infrastructure, avoiding sudden disruptions or\nsignificantly increased block sizes.\n\nTogether, I see QRAMP and BIP-360 forming a robust approach. QRAMP provides\na clear timeline and incentive for users to migrate their funds, while\nBIP-360 provides the technical standard and address types to which users\ncan securely transition. Wallets and infrastructure could offer clear user\nguidance throughout the transition period, supporting both legacy and\nquantum-resistant addresses simultaneously. Once QRAMP's deadline passes,\nthe network smoothly moves forward with only quantum-resistant addresses\nbeing valid.\n\nI think this combined approach could provide a secure, user-friendly\ntransition path, reducing the potential disruption to the network while\neffectively mitigating quantum risks. I'd really appreciate your thoughts,\nconcerns, or ideas on how we could refine this integration.\n\nRegards,\n\nAgustín Cruz\n\nEl mié, 19 de feb de 2025, 7:05 p. m., Dustin Ray <\ndustinvon",

In such a scenario, it could be highly beneficial for parties that benefit from high fees to flood the network with bogus transactions to force the fees arbitrarily high, since people would then be forced to either pay exorbitant fees to move their funds by the deadline, or lose their funds entirely. As such, this does not seem like a good idea in general, at least unless the transition period is extremely long (say 10 years or more).\n\nA less drastic proposal could be to (at least initially) only disable spending from the less common outputs that have no inherent quantum resistance by virtue of having a hashed public key, such as P2PK and P2TR, while leaving the safer variants with hashed public keys like P2PKH and P2WPKH spendable. Most analyses of quantum algorithms I have read suggest that at least initially, they would take a significant amount of time to calculate a private key even if the public key is known, which means that even if there were a quantum breakthrough, there should be a relatively low chance of having funds intercepted between broadcasting it (which would of course reveal the public key) and having it included in a block. Furthermore, there would always be the option of only revealing the transaction to a trusted miner rather than broadcasting it, foregoing the risk entirely.\n\nUTXOs with hashed public keys might still need to be disabled at some point, seeing as a non-insignificant number of them have a revealed public key due to address reuse, and that quantum computers might eventually reach the point where the chance of breaking a private key after broadcasting but before block inclusion is non-insignificant, but this should at least alleviate the initial rush of disabling everything at once.\n\n--\nBest,\nArmchairCryptologist\n\nOn Sunday, March 9th, 202",

These schemes exhibit significant storage overheads, hindering \ntheir practical application. This paper introduces ESSPI, an optimized \nmethod leveraging ECDSA/Schnorr signatures to sign the BitVMX program \ninput. With Schnorr signatures we achieve an optimal 1:1 data expansion, \ncompared to the current known best ratio of 1:200 based on Winternitz \nsignatures. To accomplish this we introduce 4 innovations to BitVMX: (1) a \nmodification of the BitVMX CPU, adding a challengeable hashing core to it, \n(2) a new partition-based search to detect fraud during hashing, (3) a new \nenhanced transaction DAG with added data-carrying transactions with a \nfraud-verifying smart-contract and (4) a novel timelock-based method for \nproving data availability to Bitcoin smart contracts. The enhanced BitVMX \nprotocol enables the verification of uncompressed inputs such as SPV \nproofs, NiPoPoWs, or longer computation integrity proofs, such as STARKs.\n\nBest, Sergio.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/3e49d257-7d44-4c19-a157-eb479ca0a4b9n%40googlegroups.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #1.2: Type: text/html, Size: 2146 bytes --]",
