So let's start with a question: if one takes an illegal picture and\nsets every 173th pixel to a red dot will it become legal?\n\nIf you have trouble imagining it, here's an example for you:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/J7RTPL7\n\nIf you believe it would, we can end this conversation and my point is moot.\nHowever, I think you'll agree the image would still be illegal.\n\nNext, I think it's obvious that an attacker seeking to harm bitcoin users\nwould choose an any image format he likes. So for this example I'm picking\nBMP.\n\nIf you encode the image above to BMP, which is uncompressed, the red pixels\nturn into bytes 253, 7, 2 which happen to encode witness element length\n519. The header size is 54 bytes, so stick the byte 54 at the front and you\nhave a valid serialization of a sequence of witness elements.\n\nDo you see what this means?\n\n\n...\n\n\nYes, it's too late to fix this. It's already trivially possible to make\nyour node store a sequence of bytes that is considered illegal. If you're\nworried about it you have to resync the chain right now.\n\nDisclaimer: the numbers above might be a bit off, I did most computation in\nmy head. Still, the point stands even if the pixels have a bit different\nspacing/color.\n\nSame thing with malware distribution, except you can easily skip the\ninvalid bytes using jump instructions or other techniques, so that might be\neven worse.\n\nHappy syncing!\n\nMartin\n\n\nDňa ut 29. 4. 2025, 11:15 Jason Hughes (wk057) <wizkid057@gmail•com>\nnapísal(a):\n\n> I was asked to take my comments to the mailing list, so here we go.\n>\n> First, see my comments on Github PR #32359:\n> - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32359#issuecomment-2835467933\n> - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32359#issuecomment-2835638919\n> - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32359#issuecomment-2834012756\n>\n> Next, I'",

If you wanted to fork off from some arbitrary point prior to the last checkpoint, you'd want to enforce the new consensus rules from that exact point (not from genesis), but that requires shipping the full node software with a hash for every possible block that could be forked off from.

This is an \ninformational BIP that seeks to officially recognize \"satoshi\" (singular) \nor \"satoshis\" (plural) as the standard term for 1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin, \nwith \"sats\" as the standard abbreviation.\n\nWhile this terminology is already widely used throughout the Bitcoin \necosystem, no formal standard exists, leading to inconsistent usage across \napplications, documentation, and communications. This BIP seeks to \nformalize what has organically become common practice.\n\nThe BIP can already be viewed here:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1841 \n<https://deref-gmx.com/mail/client/rgLlibWjbIA/dereferrer/?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbitcoin%2Fbips%2Fpull%2F1841>\n\nI'd like to note that this proposal differs from BIP-176 (Bits \nDenomination) and the recent BIP-177 proposal (Redefine Bitcoin's Base \nUnit). While those proposals suggest changing or adding denomination \nschemes, this BIP simply formalizes existing widely-used terminology \nwithout changing the underlying unit structure.\n\nI look forward to your feedback and suggestions.\n\nThank you,\n\nOceanSlim\nnpub1zmc6qyqdfnllhnzzxr5wpepfpnzcf8q6m3jdveflmgruqvd3qa9sjv7f60\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/17076438-87eb-4531-81a1-e1850dffe277n%40googlegroups.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #1.2: Type: text/html, Size: 2448 bytes --]",

That means a zero-byte annex is different from not\nhaving an annex at all.\n\nSo with my proposed rule, inputs can either have no annex at all (the\nstandard status quo), or an annex of zero or more bytes.\n\nIf any input has an annex, *all* inputs must have an annex.

But I think that's fine.\n\nYes, I agree. I believe there is one more thing to falicitate any future\npotential encoding scheme transition for application.\n\nI.e you have the 1-byte : 0x00 | <random_payload_data>, and you could\nhave a an application-only versioning of the <random_payload_data> with\none more 1-byte, to give the evolvability to application to experiment\nwith multiple parsing format.\n\nSo you would have \"1-byte\" 0x00 | \"random_payload_data\" where \n\"random_payload_data\"\nis defined as 1-byte: <version_number> | \"random_payload_data\". That\nversion number shall only have application meaning, no consensus, it's\njust some kind of clear domain separation. AFAICT, the version number\ncould be always retrofitted for a non-0x00 tag-length-value consensus\nmeaning.\n\nIf it can be useful in any way, an old annex branch with a try of TLV:\nhttps://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/commit/84a897feb20c7df813e236d6bf98b69e241a4530\n\nIMHO, this was a very positive thing for taproot to have a lot of\nversioning and upgradeability paths (e.g leaves version, pubkey type, etc).\n\n> There is a possibility of a multi-party, annex-using, protocol where\n> someone does a pinning attack by re-signing their transaction with a\n> bigger annex.

Perhaps this thread can serve as a collection point for the various historical discussions that were had on this topic.\n\nIn the context of BIP30 [0] Eric Voskuil brought up performance:\n\n>  The top checkpoint is consensus for over 11 years and materially reduces the validation cost of 295,000 blocks.\n\nI don't think performance should be a consideration when removing checkpoints.\n\nAfaik checkpoints were not introduced as a performance feature, but rather as a DoS vulnerability fix.\n\nEven if they were, imo they shouldn't be used for performance enhancement, as it creates a temptation to add more - although Eric clearly says:\n\n> I would never advocate for adding more\n\nBut perhaps someone else would fork Bitcoin Core (or Libbitcoin) and start with honest checkpoints, in order to gain adoption due its excellent performance - especially when combined with a UTXO snapshot. And then suddenly it has an \"upgrade\".\n\nBut even if this wasn't a concern, the performance benefit of the latest checkpoint from 2014 is just very small. That's because the early blocks don't have that many signatures to check. The first 5 years of Bitcoin represent only 3% of all historical transactions.\n\nOn an M4 MacBook I did an IBD up to the last checkpoint at height 295,000.

They exclude the 1.5 minutes spent on the header pre-sync mechanism, which is required to operate safely with or without (new) checkpoints. In both cases I used -dbcache=3000 to avoid UTXO set disk I/O.\n\nThe difference is 30 seconds, but let's round that up to 1 minute because my setup isn't a clean lab.\n\nA full IBD takes at least 5 hours on this machine, so the benefit is roughly 0.3% (unless we add ",

All other inputs/outputs are\nefficiently crossed off inside a single hash aggregate that only reaches\nzero if validation was successful and the hints were correct.\n\nThe main observation is that it can be much easier to validate that a given\nUTXO set is correct than to compute it yourself. It allows us to no longer\nrequire a stateful moment-to-moment UTXO set during IBD and allows\neverything to be order independent. I'll briefly summarize the protocol,\nbefore sharing the link to the full write-up.\n\nEach output gets a boolean hint (e.g. committed into Bitcoin Core) about\nwhether or not it will still be in the UTXO set after validation completes.\nIf it does, we write it to disk (append-only - it won't be used until\nSwiftSync finishes). If it does not, we hash the UTXO data and add it to an\naggregate. For each input, we once again hash the UTXO data and remove it\nfrom the aggregate.\n\nAt the end, for every added output there should have been exactly one\nremoved input, bringing the end total of the aggregate to zero. If this is\nindeed the case, we will have validated that the hints, and the resulting\nUTXO set, were correct.\n\nE.g. For spent outputs A, B and inputs C, D we calculate hash(UTXO_A||salt)\n+ hash(UTXO_B||salt) - hash(UTXO_C||salt) - hash(UTXO_D||salt) == 0\n(proving (A==C && B==D) || (A==D && B==C)).\n\nThere is one missing step. The UTXO data is only available when processing\nthe output, but not when processing the input. We resolve this by either\ndownloading the outputs that were spent for each block (equivalent to the\nundo data, maybe 10-15% of a block), or we lean on assumevalid, making it\nsufficient to only hash the outpoints (which are available in both the\noutput and input) rather than the full UTXO da",

It is based on the secp256k1 implementation in the Bitcoin Core test\nframework.\n\nOur goal was to avoid including yet another custom Python implementation of the\nsecp256k1 curve in the ChillDKG reference code. Several existing BIPs (340, 324,\n327, and 352) already contain custom and sometimes subtly diverging\nimplementations of secp256k1. This library aims to provide a single, consistent\ninterface for secp256k1-related cryptographic specifications.\n\nAt the moment, secp256k1lab is included in the ChillDKG repository as a subtree.\nIt remains an open question what would be the best approach for including ChillDKG\n(with the secp256k1lab dependency) into the bips repository [1].\n\nWe welcome your feedback and contributions to this project.\n\nBest regards,\nThe current secp256k1lab maintainers: Sebastian Falbesoner, Jonas Nick, Tim\nRuffing\n\n[0] https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg\n[1] https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/HE3HSnGTpoQ/m/Y2VhaMCrCAAJ\n     (We renamed secp256k1proto to secp256k1lab)\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/d0044f9c-d974-43ca-9891-64bb60a90f1f%40gmail.com.",

Miners would then monitor these\noutputs and claim them as they become available.\n\nFor example, allow a 1% reward to be spent freely to any address but\nrequire 99% to be sent to an OP_CLTV output timelocked to a\ndeterministically random height between 10-100 years from now.\n\nThe 1% reward could also be required to be sent to a script that enforces a\ntimelock (in addition to other conditions), to avoid flooding the markets\nwith the rewarded coins all at once. Probably a shorter timelock duration\nthough, say picked randomly between 10-30 months.\n\nTo further smooth out variance in the release schedule, coins could be\nsplit into up-to-N-BTC outputs, each staggered with a different\ndeterministic timelock. So for example, a single tx spending 10,000 BTC\nwon't release 9,900 BTC to the miners in a single far-future block (which\nmay cause chain instability if the miners get into a reorg war over it),\nbut rather as 9,900 separate outputs of 1 BTC each released gradually\ntime.[1]\n\nI'm still not sure what I think about this. This is not necessarily an\nendorsement, just a thought. :)\n\n- shesek\n\n[0] OP_CSV only supports relative timelocks of up to 65535 blocks (~15\nmonths), which is too short for that purpose. OP_CLTV supports longer\n(absolute) timelocks.\n\n[1] This can be made more efficient with CTV, by having a single UTXO\ncarrying the full amount that slowly unrolls rather than 9,900 separate\nUTXO entries.\n\n\nOn Sun, Mar 16, 2025 at 5:22 PM Jameson Lopp <jameson.lopp@gmail•com> wrote:\n\n> The quantum computing debat",

Consolidation of inputs\nis often bad for privacy and makes silent payments, coinjoin etc. useless\nin some cases however the user has the choice to select coins manually\nwhile transacting. In payjoin, users can't do much about it. They have to\nshare UTXOs in response to the original PSBT along with the address to\nreceive bitcoin.\n\n> In the payjoin setting, the receiver is\n> using coinswap in that manner, then as a payjoin receiver they can\n> elect to only use coinswapped coins as contributed inputs to payjoin\n> transactions.\n\nIt could be a workaround or temporary fix for this problem. However, if\nswapped coins are used in transactions, octojoin could be a better solution\nwhich doesn't require any inputs from the recipient.\n\n> I'm not sure what you mean by \"the recipient would never doubt it\n> because it's a privacy tool\", it sounds to me like this is mainly a\n> criticism of the UX of payjoin supporting wallets, or of wallets in\n> general for not educating users that privacy is not a binary thing?\n\nThe recipient would never doubt a sender who insists on using payjoin and\nnot interested in a normal bitcoin transaction. They would not know the\nintentions of the sender before payjoin.\n\n> Note that in all of these specifications of payjoin UTXO probing is\n> not costless since the sender must send a fully signed transaction in\n> order to learn such a UTXO, and this transaction although not\n> confirmed still imposes a fee cost on the sender if broadcast (even if\n> it is replaced).\n\nIt was costless in the demo which could be fixed by bullbitcoin.

A covenant is a set of rules about what transactions can\nspend a Bitcoin output which is encumbered by that covenant. Typically\na covenant is enforced by preventing someone from spending that\noutput. In this protocol we instead allow the spending of the output\nand then punish the spender by a loss of funds, i.e. we slash them, if\nthey do not follow the rules of the covenant. This is less secure than\na covenant enforced by an opcode, FE or ColliderScript, because it\nrelies on incentives over enforcement. The advantage of this approach\nis that it is efficient, does not add new cryptographic assumptions\nand is possible on Bitcoin today.\n\nThis protocol uses very similar mechanisms to BitVM, originally I\nthought this was how BitVM worked, which is why I didn’t publish it.\nAfter talking to many people it appears this technique is not used in\nBitVM.\n\n\nNotation\n====\nBy <x>32 we denote a value, x, in Bitcoin Script which is encoded as a\nlist of 32-bit stack elements. We can perform arbitrary computation on\nsuch values using Bitcoin’s math opcodes, a.k.a., Small Script.\n\nProtocol\n====\nThe essential problem for enforcing covenants in Bitcoin outputs is\nshowing that a signature s1 that will pass CHECKSIGVERIFY is equal to\na signature s2 encoded for Small Script. This is because once we get a\nsignature into Small Script, we extract the sighash and do transaction\nintrospection. ColliderScript gets us covenants by using hash\ncollisions to check equality between s1 and <s2>32. CAT gets us\ncovenants by simply concatenating all the <s2>32 and then comparing\nagainst s1 using EQUAL:\n\ns2 = CAT(<s2>32 [0], <s2>32 [1],  <s2>32 [2], … <s2>32 [15])\nEQUAL s1, s2\n\nSlashing covenants works by removing the requirement for this equality\ncheck, but instead providing a fraud proof ifs1!=s2, and posting that\nfraud proof to punish the spending party.

Both of these proposals\naim to protect Bitcoin from potential quantum computing threats, but they\napproach the problem from slightly different angles. I believe they could\ncomplement each other nicely.\n\nThe QRAMP proposal introduces a mandatory migration period after which\nspending from legacy ECDSA-based addresses becomes invalid. The goal is to\npush users proactively towards quantum-resistant addresses, ensuring older,\npotentially vulnerable public keys are phased out before quantum computing\nposes a real threat.\n\nMeanwhile, BIP-360 defines a new quantum-resistant address format and\nassociated transaction validation rules. It introduces hash-based and\nhybrid post-quantum signatures, designed specifically to integrate smoothly\nwith Bitcoin’s current infrastructure, avoiding sudden disruptions or\nsignificantly increased block sizes.\n\nTogether, I see QRAMP and BIP-360 forming a robust approach. QRAMP provides\na clear timeline and incentive for users to migrate their funds, while\nBIP-360 provides the technical standard and address types to which users\ncan securely transition. Wallets and infrastructure could offer clear user\nguidance throughout the transition period, supporting both legacy and\nquantum-resistant addresses simultaneously. Once QRAMP's deadline passes,\nthe network smoothly moves forward with only quantum-resistant addresses\nbeing valid.\n\nI think this combined approach could provide a secure, user-friendly\ntransition path, reducing the potential disruption to the network while\neffectively mitigating quantum risks. I'd really appreciate your thoughts,\nconcerns, or ideas on how we could refine this integration.\n\nRegards,\n\nAgustín Cruz\n\nEl mié, 19 de feb de 2025, 7:05 p. m., Dustin Ray <\ndustinvon",

In such a scenario, it could be highly beneficial for parties that benefit from high fees to flood the network with bogus transactions to force the fees arbitrarily high, since people would then be forced to either pay exorbitant fees to move their funds by the deadline, or lose their funds entirely. As such, this does not seem like a good idea in general, at least unless the transition period is extremely long (say 10 years or more).\n\nA less drastic proposal could be to (at least initially) only disable spending from the less common outputs that have no inherent quantum resistance by virtue of having a hashed public key, such as P2PK and P2TR, while leaving the safer variants with hashed public keys like P2PKH and P2WPKH spendable. Most analyses of quantum algorithms I have read suggest that at least initially, they would take a significant amount of time to calculate a private key even if the public key is known, which means that even if there were a quantum breakthrough, there should be a relatively low chance of having funds intercepted between broadcasting it (which would of course reveal the public key) and having it included in a block. Furthermore, there would always be the option of only revealing the transaction to a trusted miner rather than broadcasting it, foregoing the risk entirely.\n\nUTXOs with hashed public keys might still need to be disabled at some point, seeing as a non-insignificant number of them have a revealed public key due to address reuse, and that quantum computers might eventually reach the point where the chance of breaking a private key after broadcasting but before block inclusion is non-insignificant, but this should at least alleviate the initial rush of disabling everything at once.\n\n--\nBest,\nArmchairCryptologist\n\nOn Sunday, March 9th, 202",
