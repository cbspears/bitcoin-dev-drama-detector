I don't expect\npeople to reliably express the degree to which AI was used to inform the\nthinking behind the BIP, or the writing itself. I'm not aware of any common\nstandard we would use to express those things. Adversarially, we have to\nassume people won't do it if it's not in their interests.\n\nRather, I think the expectation should be that BIP proposers are entirely\nresponsible for submitting high quality BIPs and they take ownership for\nwhat they are submitting (submitting garbage burns your rep, always has and\nalways will). BIP reviewers should simply assume for all BIPs that AI was\nlikely used significantly to create them, and judge BIPs only on the merit\nof the ideas and content.\n\nBecause of the advent of LLMs (and their inevitable continued improvement)\nthis will almost certainly result in an increased number of BIPs being\nadvanced, many of low (slop-filled) quality but also, hopefully, more high\nquality ones as well—proposals that might not otherwise have seen the light\nof day and/or proposals themselves being strengthened with better\narguments, ideas and language.\n\nThe solution to such a rise in volume IMO is that BIP reviewers should also\nequip themselves with LLMs and other AI-powered tools to help\nfilter/triage/assess BIPs to get a handle on the rise in noise level. Yet,\njust like BIP proposers, the onus should be on BIP reviewers to take\nownership for the quality of the decision-making around BIP quality and\nthat it not ever be entirely automated but retain \"human in the loop\"\njudgment—at least for the foreseeable future—just made more efficient and\neffective through the use of AI.\n\nOn Thu, Nov 20, 2025 at 1:47 AM Oghenovo Usiwoma <eunovo9@gmail•com> wrote:\n\n> > I think it makes sense to request that submissions should state if - and\n> to what degree - AI has been use",

Some wallet devs \n*today* don't even bother with multi-address support, so imagine if to do \nso effeciently, they needed to statefully track prior UTXOs and generate \naddresses based on a changing UTXO set over time.\n\nAlso I want to mention, there's a big privacy difference between these CISA \ntechniques, and CISA via address reuse. \n\nIf I receive two payments to the same address, i immediately reveal that \nthose UTXOs are owned by the same entity: me.\n\nIf I receive two payments to *distinct* addresses which are linked via your \nOP_CIV (or via my idea by committing to pubkeys) then I can choose when and \nwhether to reveal the fact that those UTXOs are commonly owned. Most user \nwallets have more than just two UTXOs, so in a setting where I have \npossibly dozens of UTXOs, this offers me more flexibility with respect to \nmy on-chain privacy, allowing me to choose when and how to reveal common \nUTXO ownership. This is kind of already the status quo, because chainalysis \nuses common-input ownership heuristics even if they are flawed/incorrect, \njust for the sake of having a \"working\" tool they can sell.\n\nRegarding the extra cost, we can quantify that! Let's say we have a taptree \nof height `h` with `2^h` leaves. We use one leaf for a unique pubkey, and \nthe other `2^h - 1` tap leaves store commitments to other pubkeys or to \npre-existing UTXOs. To spend a TX with `n` inputs using this CISA paradigm, \nwe need one signature, plus `n - 1` taproot control blocks and tapscripts. \nEach control block has size `h * 32`, plus ~32 bytes to reference the other \npubkey or UTXO in the locking tapscript. So in total, the witness size \nscales as: `(n - 1)((h + 1) * 32)`. In other words, for every additional \ninput covered by the CISA scheme, we must pay for roughly `(h + 1) * 32",

          "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am thrilled to announce the public release of Penlock!\n\nThe goal is achieved! If you have a printer, scissors, a craft knife,\nand a pin, you can mechanically secret-split a 12-word seed phrase\nin under two hours. This includes the entire process—learning,\nprinting, assembling, executing, and storing the shares.\n\nPenlock is a printable paper calculator that guides you through\nsplitting a seed phrase into a 2-of-3 backup. It is open-source,\nuses straightforward and robust cryptography, and includes various\nfail-safes that protect against errors. A beta was announced on\nthis list last year, and the public release is now available at:\n<https://v1.penlock.io/en/>\n\nThis release breaks backward-compatibility with the beta, allowing for\nenhancements that make Penlock significantly easier to operate. Here\nare the main improvements in v1:\n\n- Faster Secret-Splitting: Penlock now focuses exclusively on producing\n2-of-3 backups using its own paper-optimized splitting algorithm. The\nprevious iteration supported K-of-M splitting with Shamir Secret\nSharing, but at the cost of more complexity and a clunkier 2-of-3\nprocess. Since 2-of-3 covers nearly all use cases, optimizing for it\nseemed like the right approach.\n\n- Backup Strategy Template: Penlock now suggests a generic, adaptable\nbackup strategy that helps set up offsite recovery and trust-minimized\ninheritance. In short, each share is tied to a different type of\nstorage: Digital, Social, and (optionally) Legal. This ensures an\nattacker would have to run two different types of attacks, and makes\nit hard for a party holding one share to obtain a second one. You\ncan find more details at <https://v1.penlock.io/en/split#strategy>.\n\n- On-Paper Error Correction: Penlock v1 introduces what I believe to\nbe the first on-paper error correction algorithm. Each BIP39 word is\nextended with two pre-computed parity symbols, guaranteeing per-word\nunambiguous correction of 1 error and detection of 2. In practice,\nit's also poss",

Biggest changes from latest release has\nbeen mostly working on BIP324 re-implementation, cleaning bugs\nimplementing a simple tx-relay stack, a little mempoool buffer\nand some groundworks on address management. Tx syncing works with\nvanilla bitcoin core v0.30 software.\n\nI did a layout of the process architecture on the website, but the\nmempool is fully living in its own mempool process, fully separate\nfrom the block pipeline. In case of mempool DoS for whatever reasons,\nthe full-node keeps processing blocks. This also opens the door to\nhave *multiple* mempools with incompatible policies among themselves,\nand just select the highest fees paying graph of consensus-valid\ntransactions, after sanitizing out conflicts.\n\nAs I was writing in my latest email about bitcoin backbone, of course\nthere are some trade-offs with the mempool not living in the same memory\nspace than the validation engine, though I think you have practical\nimprovements on this area.\n\nThe simple tx-relay stack also implements a basic implementation of the\nproposed overhaul of the tx-relay v2 [0]. Currently, the tx flow is\nINV(txid) -> ; <- GETDATA(inv(txid)) ; TX(tx) -> . With the proposed \ntx-relay\nv2 overhaul, if an INV for the txid has not previously received for the\ntransaction, i.e the transaction processing has not been requested, the\ntransaction is strictly rejected, without further processing. This more\nstricter tx processing can be activated with a setting option in bitcoin\nbackbone.\n\nLong-term, I think some form of tx-relay link-level mitigation is a strong\nnecessity to diminish the surface attack of time-sensitive contracting\nprotocol in face of tx-relay throughput overflow, where a malicious peer\nis buying out your full-node tx bandwidth to tamper with the propagation\nof a time-sensitive tx (e.g a lightning's HTLC-preimage) [1].\n\nThe d",

Very large means enough that majority hash power has a true \ndisincentive to intentionally mine invalid blocks, despite the reward for \ndoing so (e.g. unlimited inflation). What you are calling \"archival nodes\" \ndon't actually \"preserve the full chain\" for everyone else, because their \neffect is limited to their own transactions.

It contains extensive testing\nof each of the four proposed mitigations, and was used as a basis to generate test vectors for\nBIP54. I opened a PR against the BIPs repository to add them to BIP54 [1].\n\nThe test vectors for the transaction-level sigops limit contain a wide variety of usage combinations\nas well as ways of running into the limit. They also include some historical violations as well as\npathological transactions demonstrating the implementation details of the sigop accounting logic\n(which was itself borrowed from that of BIP16, which all Bitcoin implementations presumably already\nhave).\n\nThe test vectors for the new witness-stripped transaction size restriction similarly exercise the\nbounds of the check under various conditions (e.g. transactions with/without a witness). All\nhistorical violations were also added to the test vectors, thanks to Chris Stewart for digging those\nup.\n\nBecause the new timestamp restrictions are tailor-made to the mainnet difficulty adjustment\nparameters, the test vectors for those contain a number of chains of mainnet headers (from genesis).\nEach test case contains a full header chain and whether it is valid according to BIP54. These chains\nwere generated using a custom miner available in [2] and added to the implementation as a JSON data\nfile.\n\nThe test vectors for the coinbase restriction similarly include a chain of mainnet blocks, because\nthe timelock check is context-dependent. These were generated using a similar miner also available\nat [2].\n\nI'm seeking feedback on these test vectors from everybody but in particular developers of\nalternative Bitcoin clients, as compatibility with other Bitcoin implementations than Bitcoin Core\nwas a design goal.\n\nBest,\nAntoine Poinsot\n\n[0]: https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/99\n[1]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/201",

Yes my wonder is more if you put yourself in the \nshoes of an attacker,\nand you have to calculate your cost for an attack, what is the most \ninteresting between playing on\nthe number of prevout lookups and maximizing the quadratic hashing. I do \nbelieve the proposed 2500\nsigops limit is slashing the quadratic hashing worst-case concern, while at \nthe same time not providing\nan advantage to the attacker on the prevout lookup cost. Say differently, I \nbelieve we should ensure that\nany introduced DoS limit in the goal to reduce worst-case for a DoS vector \nA do not downgrade the worst-case\nfor another DoS vector B. \n\nPreviously, as the way the novel limit was proposed in abstracto, I had a \nconcern with given that\nif you take for example bitcoin core multiple input checks where made \n(first all scripts flags and\nthen for consensus mandatory script flags) [0], a DoS attacker could have \ndeliberately make the\nscript failed on a policy flag and then make it hard fails on the novel \n2500 limit, _at a cheaper\nprice_ (less CHECKMULTISIG bytes to pack in the tx). I don't think it's a \nconcern anymore as after\n[1] and others, there is no double validation anymore and \n`CheckSigOpsBIP54` has been implemented\nwith the other policy check limits.\n\nOf course the number of CHECKMULTISIG bytes to pack is only a concern for \nan attacker in the situation\nwhere satoshis have to be provided to pass the `min_relay_feerate` policy \nrule, but it's a realistic\nlimit one has to reason when you're considering the cost of network-wide \nDoS. Somehow, you're maximizing\nthe higher DoS cost per byte per satoshi you might have to commit in a \nsingle tx.\n\nDisagree with you on the prevout lookup cost exploitation, as I think there \nis at least variant to\nattempt to slash the cost for an attacker for some categories of DoS.

It introduces a \ndedicated, structured, full-fee data lane for on-chain data, without \ndisrupting existing transaction rules. Think of it like this - segOP is to \narbitrary data what SegWit was to signatures — a clean, isolated, \nforward-compatible path that preserves old-node harmony while restoring fee \nfairness.\n\nAbstract:\n\n    segOP defines a new segregated data section for Bitcoin transactions, \ncryptographically committed via OP_SUCCESS184. It standardizes on-chain \nmetadata storage by enforcing full fees, structured TLV encoding, and a 100 \nKB cap, while remaining backward-compatible with legacy nodes.\n\nIt is not:\n\n    - A replacement for OP_RETURN\n    - An off-chain mechanism\n    - A hard fork\n\nIt is:\n\n    - A soft-fork-safe, future-proof, SegWit-style data section\n    - Full-fee (4 weight units per byte)\n    - Structured (TLV + Merkle-root verified)\n    - Limited to 100 KB per transaction\n\nWhat issues could segOP rectify?:\n\n    1. Ordinals abuse witness discount. segOP will apply full fee rate for \nlarge data.\n    2. No structured metadata lane. segOP introduces TLV-encoded + \nMerkle-verified section.\n    3. Witness discount abused for megabytes. segOP Enforces 100 KB cap.\n    4. OP_RETURN unstructured & limited. segOP = structured + verifiable.\n    5. Spam cheap storage. segOP deters spam with fees.\n\n    In short - segOP restores fairness — data pays its real weight cost, \npreserving block space for financial use.\n\nWhere segOP lives:\n\n    Transaction Layout (Post-segOP)\n    Transaction\n    ├── nVersion\n    ├── vin (inputs)\n    ├── vout (o",

If it was cheaper than witness space,\nI think it would be a serious consideration especially for rollups.\nThe idea that the bytes incur full cost (4WU) makes it on arrival economically speaking.\n\nAlso it's a bit unclear how consensus and nodes in sync would interact with the \"recent window\".\n\nIt's a reasonable approach to mandate the presence of such an extension block near the chain-tip, but\nnodes by default should not download or verify it during IBD. This would only add a constant burden to nodes,\nwhile allowing bitcoin to scale on higher layers more that require such proof of publication mechanism for\ntheir security.\n\nThinking that this would be used by graffiti type payloads that especially are seeking the permanence, persistence\nand replication of bitcoin transactional data, or that metaprotocols that want to use the block space as an archival\nlayer for their own token ledgers is I'm afraid completely misguided or even delusional.\n\nBR,\nmoonsettler\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/3S1IMGSH6z-3Ho81Ugp9o-ltTwpIC-4ow6bn6aEAtK4XrkG5HTkvTw0BeZFpPILfabdp7rz_LDHEBWX_XZk0a7nKR4sJRUp_3B7pAMaJ86I%3D%40protonmail.com.",

I can imagine a Script, which could allow something like\n1-of-460 multisig: if all public keys would be hashed, then it would take\n21 bytes to push any given hash. And then, pushing 460 hashes would take\n460*21=9660 bytes. Then, to clean it up, OP_2DROP would consume two\nelements, so that means 230 bytes, to clean it up with OP_2DROPs, and a\nsingle OP_DROP.\n\nI think it could be something like that:\n\nOP_TOALTSTACK <9660 bytes> OP_FROMALTSTACK OP_PICK OP_TOALTSTACK\n<OP_2DROP*229> OP_DROP\nOP_DUP OP_HASH160 OP_FROMALTSTACK OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\n\nAnd then, this is how it could be executed:\n\n<sig> <pubkey> <number>                    //input stack\n<sig> <pubkey>                             //toaltstack\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes>            //pushing hashes\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes> <number>   //pushing number\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes> <hash>     //picking hash\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes>            //toaltstack\n<sig> <pubkey>                             //dropping the rest\n<sig> <pubkey> <pubkey>                    //dup\n<sig> <pubkey> <hash>                      //hash160\n<sig> <pubkey> <hash> <hash>               //fromaltstack\n<sig> <pubkey>                             //equalverify\nOP_TRUE                                    //checksig\n\nWhich means, that it would take 9660 bytes, plus 230 bytes of dropping, so\nit sums up to 9890 bytes. Then, 9 bytes are consumed by the rest of the\nenvelope, and that leaves 101 bytes for signature and public key. Seems\ndoable.

I wondered if \nwe could leverage the existing mining infrastructure instead of building \nseparate systems.\n\nMy goal was to find a scaling solution that:\n\n\n   - Eliminates watchtower requirements by using miners (who are already \n   always online)\n   - Avoids channel-based routing complexities\n   - Guarantees eventual settlement\n   - Creates natural economic incentives for all participants\n\nI'm not a Bitcoin developer, but I wanted to share this concept with the \ncommunity to see if others think it could work and how it might be \nimplemented.

Once enough miners have \nvalidated your ATX and added it to the pool (validation threshold to be \ndetermined, e.g., 10-30% of hashpower depending on amount), the recipient \ncan consider it \"confirmed\". Double-spending is prevented because miners \ntimestamp and validate each forward, with first-seen winning, and check \nagainst the anticipation pool, mempool and blockchain to ensure the outputs \nhaven't been spent elsewhere.\n\nThe ATX has a timelock (e.g. 30 days), during this time only the recipient \ncan publish it to the mempool, forward it to someone else (including to \nthemselves), or split it to multiple people.

It has already been reported in\na GitHub [issue][0] and shared on social media. However, I wanted to\nformally disclose it on the mailing list so that all users are aware of the\nrisks. The full disclosure approach is primarily used when vulnerabilities\nare ignored. It is exactly what happened in this case although it has been\n[fixed][1] in bitcoin knots which also persists the history to disk.\n\nSome RPC commands use private keys, wallet passphrase etc. in their\narguments and this remained in the debug console history until [2016][2].\nAn attacker can no longer see the history and get sensitive information\nwith the history filter. However, [`migratewallet`][3] wasn't added in the\nhistory filter. This allows an attacker with access to the victim's machine\nto get the wallet passphrase from the history. GUI has an option to migrate\nthe wallet without using RPC commands in the debug console since v26.0 but\nsome users may prefer RPC over it.\n\n```\n// don't add private key handling cmd's to the history\nconst QStringList historyFilter = QStringList()\n    << \"signmessagewithprivkey\"\n    << \"signrawtransactionwithkey\"\n    << \"walletpassphrase\"\n    << \"walletpassphrasechange\"\n    << \"encryptwallet\";\n\n\n}\n```\n\nTimeline:\n02 October 2025: User [reported][4] the issue in bitcoin knots telegram\ngroup\n02 October 2025: I opened the pull request to fix the issue in knots repo\n11 October 2025: [knots v29.2][5] released with the fix\n11 October 2025: I acknowledged the bug in bitcoin core repo and\nwaketraindev opened a [pull request][6] to fix it\n24 October 2025: Full disclosure as bitcoin core remains vulnerable\n\nCredits:\nwaketraindev\nlukedashjr\n\n[0]: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/897\n[1]: https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin/pull/203\n[2]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8877\n[3]: h",

One of these has since been promoted to medium severity, and its public\ndisclosure has therefore been rescheduled in accordance with our policy.\n\nThe four vulnerabilities publicly disclosed today are the following:\n- CVE-2025-54604: Disk filling from spoofed self connections [0]\n- CVE-2025-54605: Disk filling from invalid blocks [1]\n- CVE-2025-46597: Highly unlikely remote crash on 32-bit systems [2]\n- CVE-2025-46598: CPU DoS from unconfirmed transaction processing [3]\n\nThe fixes for CVE-2025-54604, CVE-2025-54605 and CVE-2025-46597 are also included in Bitcoin Core\nversion 29.1 and later minor releases. Thanks to Eugene Siegel, Niklas Goegge and Pieter Wuille for\nreporting these issues and to everyone involved in fixing them.\n\nOur disclosure policy as well as previously disclosed vulnerabilities are available on the Bitcoin\nCore website at [4].\n\nAntoine Poinsot\n\n[0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2025/10/24/disclose-cve-2025-54604/\n[1]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2025/10/24/disclose-cve-2025-54605/\n[2]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2025/10/24/disclose-cve-2025-46597/\n[3]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2025/10/24/disclose-cve-2025-46598/\n[4]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/security-advisories/\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/I5lwexjm1EkKFZpV4_A4b6XvYXvIGjJZ3UpYhfzeC4rXmnNDVQ0Mob4X1We1hmWaisx_0ZSNn6BKH99kfig6rTChHbsCPMZBk2k0ua1E8Ng%3D%40protonmail.com.",

The main difference is that all integers are now\nunsigned: the combination of variable length and sign bit was a\nside-effect of the SSL bignum representation and has proven awkward to\ndeal with.\n\n    A word on the example implementation which was used to benchmark: it\ntreats numerical stack objects 64 bits at a time, but does not go so far\nas using assembly code.  It also had to implement a proper stack class,\nbecause the time to enforce the new \"total stack size limit\" naively was\nmeasurable.  I consider it a fair benchmark when considering how a\nstraightforward implementation would perform.\n\nThank you for your consideration,\nRusty.\n\n<pre>\n  BIP: ?\n  Layer: Consensus (soft fork)\n  Title: Restoration of disabled script functionality (Tapscript v2)\n  Author: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp•com.au>\n          Julian Moik <julianmoik@gmail•com>\n  Comments-URI: TBA\n  Status: Draft\n  Type: Standards Track\n  Created: 2025-05-16\n  License: BSD-3-Clause\n</pre>\n\n==Introduction==\n\n===Abstract===\n\nThis new BIP introduces a new tapleaf version (0xc2) which restores Bitcoin script to its pre-0.3.1 capability, relying on the Varops Budget in [[bip-unknown-varops-budget.mediawiki|BIP-varops]] to prevent the excessive computational time which caused CVE-2010-5137.\n\nIn particular, this BIP:\n- Reenables disabled opcodes.\n- Increases the maximum stack object size from 520 bytes to 4,000,000 bytes.\n- Introduces a total stack byte limit of 8,000,000 bytes.\n- Increases the maximum total number of stack objects from 1000 to 32768.\n- Removes the 32-bit size restriction on numerical values.\n- Treats all numerical values as unsigned.\n\n===Copyright===\n\nThis document is licensed under the 3-clause BSD license.\n\n===Motivation===\n\nSince Bitcoin v0.3.1 (addressing CVE-2010-5137), Bitcoin's scripting capabilities have been sign",

Note that expressing \"negative\" values are probably desirable,\nparticularly -G; eg the BIP340 signature equation becomes:\n\n   s*(-G) + 1*R + H(..)*P = 0\n\nin that model. The Taproot address check is:\n\n   (+/-)1*T = 1*IPK + H(..)*G = 0\n\nwhere the sign for T is taken from the control block.\n\nFWIW, bll does this with the `secp256k1_muladd` opcode, and example code\nfor verifying a taproot script against a scriptPubKey is at\nhttps://github.com/ajtowns/bllsh/blob/master/examples/test-taproot\n\nCheers,\naj\n\n-- \nYou ",

The purpose of your mempool on your\nnode on your PC is whatever you want it to be -- eg, I have a node that\nhas a mempool with an expiry time of 2 years instead of the default 7\ndays, because I wanted to see if low fee txs eventually got resolved in\nsome way after long high fee periods.\n\nFor many things, approximating the transactions that an economically\nrational miner would put in the next block is great:\n\n * if you're a miner yourself, you maximise your revenue if you happen\n   to get the next block (since that's how \"economically rational\"\n   is usually defined)\n\n * if you're sending transactions, it helps you predict if/when your\n   tx will be included in a block, and helps you figure out what fee\n   rate you should use\n\n * it helps you reconstruct and relay blocks more quickly (and relaying\n   blocks more quickly helps others reconstruct blocks more quickly)\n\n * if you're sharing utxos with someone (lightning, or potentially ark\n   or DLC bets), it helps give you advance warning if they're initiating\n   a spend of that utxo in case you need to react to it\n\nEven so, \"approximate\" is doing a chunk of work here: given the\npossibility of (a) broadcasting double spends, (b) inconsistent\npropagation, (c) new relay features, (d) some miners not being perfectly\neconomically rational, and (e) software not being bug free, the next block\ncan only be approximated, and we should (and largely do!) still perform\nth",
