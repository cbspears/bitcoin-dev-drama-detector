It contains extensive testing\nof each of the four proposed mitigations, and was used as a basis to generate test vectors for\nBIP54. I opened a PR against the BIPs repository to add them to BIP54 [1].\n\nThe test vectors for the transaction-level sigops limit contain a wide variety of usage combinations\nas well as ways of running into the limit. They also include some historical violations as well as\npathological transactions demonstrating the implementation details of the sigop accounting logic\n(which was itself borrowed from that of BIP16, which all Bitcoin implementations presumably already\nhave).\n\nThe test vectors for the new witness-stripped transaction size restriction similarly exercise the\nbounds of the check under various conditions (e.g. transactions with/without a witness). All\nhistorical violations were also added to the test vectors, thanks to Chris Stewart for digging those\nup.\n\nBecause the new timestamp restrictions are tailor-made to the mainnet difficulty adjustment\nparameters, the test vectors for those contain a number of chains of mainnet headers (from genesis).\nEach test case contains a full header chain and whether it is valid according to BIP54. These chains\nwere generated using a custom miner available in [2] and added to the implementation as a JSON data\nfile.\n\nThe test vectors for the coinbase restriction similarly include a chain of mainnet blocks, because\nthe timelock check is context-dependent. These were generated using a similar miner also available\nat [2].\n\nI'm seeking feedback on these test vectors from everybody but in particular developers of\nalternative Bitcoin clients, as compatibility with other Bitcoin implementations than Bitcoin Core\nwas a design goal.\n\nBest,\nAntoine Poinsot\n\n[0]: https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/99\n[1]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/201",

Yes my wonder is more if you put yourself in the \nshoes of an attacker,\nand you have to calculate your cost for an attack, what is the most \ninteresting between playing on\nthe number of prevout lookups and maximizing the quadratic hashing. I do \nbelieve the proposed 2500\nsigops limit is slashing the quadratic hashing worst-case concern, while at \nthe same time not providing\nan advantage to the attacker on the prevout lookup cost. Say differently, I \nbelieve we should ensure that\nany introduced DoS limit in the goal to reduce worst-case for a DoS vector \nA do not downgrade the worst-case\nfor another DoS vector B. \n\nPreviously, as the way the novel limit was proposed in abstracto, I had a \nconcern with given that\nif you take for example bitcoin core multiple input checks where made \n(first all scripts flags and\nthen for consensus mandatory script flags) [0], a DoS attacker could have \ndeliberately make the\nscript failed on a policy flag and then make it hard fails on the novel \n2500 limit, _at a cheaper\nprice_ (less CHECKMULTISIG bytes to pack in the tx). I don't think it's a \nconcern anymore as after\n[1] and others, there is no double validation anymore and \n`CheckSigOpsBIP54` has been implemented\nwith the other policy check limits.\n\nOf course the number of CHECKMULTISIG bytes to pack is only a concern for \nan attacker in the situation\nwhere satoshis have to be provided to pass the `min_relay_feerate` policy \nrule, but it's a realistic\nlimit one has to reason when you're considering the cost of network-wide \nDoS. Somehow, you're maximizing\nthe higher DoS cost per byte per satoshi you might have to commit in a \nsingle tx.\n\nDisagree with you on the prevout lookup cost exploitation, as I think there \nis at least variant to\nattempt to slash the cost for an attacker for some categories of DoS. But \nyes seen the calculations\nfor various DoS blocks, and that can be discussed",

But I lean\ntowards using outpoints mostly for privacy reasons.\n\nIt seems that if you're OK with having 1 address link to another\naddress, then an obvious optimization would be to have the addresses\nimplicitly linked to themselves.  So if a transaction has 2 inputs,\nboth with the same scriptPubKey, only 1 of them needs to sign.  Why\nbother sending and verifying 2 signatures from the same key?\n\nBut if you do implement that, then the incentive for all wallets is to\njust use 1 address.  Because not only is it simpler, it's also\ncheaper.\n\nPart of why I like linking to outpoints is that it disincentivizes\naddress re-use.  If you just keep using the same address many times,\nyou can't use OP_CIV, and can't get any fee savings through it.  If\ninstead you generate a new address each time you need one, and that\naddress commits to some / most of your UTXOs at the time, then you can\nuse OP_CIV and will have lower fees when spending.  You could, in\ntheory, use the same root pubkey and *only* change which OP_CIV\nbranches you add, but that seems like a bad idea: if you're changing\nthe address anyway, why not change the pubkey.\n\nA related reason is that in SPHINCS+ and other hash-based signature\ndesigns, one of the most important parameters is how many times a\npubkey can be re-used before becoming insecure.  Since in bitcoin we\ntend to want to discourage address re-use, it makes sense to reduce\nthat parameter, which would give smaller, faster to verify signatures,\nat the cost of not allowing many instances of address re-use.\n\nThese are somewhat subjective reasons, and I agree th",

I was notified of my incorrect \nactions versus core procedures.\n\nSee attached or below - my proposal for discussion.\n\nRegards\n\nDefenwycke.\n\n---\n\nA proposed discussion of segOP\nAuthor: Defenwycke / defenwycke@icloud•com\n29.10.2025\n\nsegOP (Segregated OP_RETURN)\n\n    A proposed extension to Bitcoin transactions. It introduces a \ndedicated, structured, full-fee data lane for on-chain data, without \ndisrupting existing transaction rules. Think of it like this - segOP is to \narbitrary data what SegWit was to signatures — a clean, isolated, \nforward-compatible path that preserves old-node harmony while restoring fee \nfairness.\n\nAbstract:\n\n    segOP defines a new segregated data section for Bitcoin transactions, \ncryptographically committed via OP_SUCCESS184. It standardizes on-chain \nmetadata storage by enforcing full fees, structured TLV encoding, and a 100 \nKB cap, while remaining backward-compatible with legacy nodes.\n\nIt is not:\n\n    - A replacement for OP_RETURN\n    - An off-chain mechanism\n    - A hard fork\n\nIt is:\n\n    - A soft-fork-safe, future-proof, SegWit-style data section\n    - Full-fee (4 weight units per byte)\n    - Structured (TLV + Merkle-root verified)\n    - Limited to 100 KB per transaction\n\nWhat issues could segOP rectify?:\n\n    1. Ordinals abuse witness discount. segOP will apply full fee rate for \nlarge data.\n    2. No structured metadata lane. segOP introduces TLV-encoded + \nMerkle-verified section.\n    3. Witness discount abused for megabytes. segOP Enforces 100 KB cap.\n    4. OP_RETURN unstructured & limited. segOP = structured + verifiable.\n    5. Spam cheap storage. segOP deters spam with fees.\n\n    In short - segOP restores fairness — data pays its real weight cost, \npreserving block space for financial use.\n\nWhere segOP lives:\n\n    Transaction Layout (Post-segOP)\n    Transaction\n    ├── nVersion\n    ├── vin (inputs)\n    ├── vout (o",

If it was cheaper than witness space,\nI think it would be a serious consideration especially for rollups.\nThe idea that the bytes incur full cost (4WU) makes it on arrival economically speaking.\n\nAlso it's a bit unclear how consensus and nodes in sync would interact with the \"recent window\".\n\nIt's a reasonable approach to mandate the presence of such an extension block near the chain-tip, but\nnodes by default should not download or verify it during IBD. This would only add a constant burden to nodes,\nwhile allowing bitcoin to scale on higher layers more that require such proof of publication mechanism for\ntheir security.\n\nThinking that this would be used by graffiti type payloads that especially are seeking the permanence, persistence\nand replication of bitcoin transactional data, or that metaprotocols that want to use the block space as an archival\nlayer for their own token ledgers is I'm afraid completely misguided or even delusional.\n\nBR,\nmoonsettler\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/3S1IMGSH6z-3Ho81Ugp9o-ltTwpIC-4ow6bn6aEAtK4XrkG5HTkvTw0BeZFpPILfabdp7rz_LDHEBWX_XZk0a7nKR4sJRUp_3B7pAMaJ86I%3D%40protonmail.com.",

Section 8 of the white paper also discusses honest\nnodes and which transactions are accepted into blocks.\n\nSatoshi further clarified standardness:\n\"The design supports a broad range of transaction types that are possible,\nbut not all are standard. Standard transactions are the ones that are\ndesigned to be used for the common case.\"\n-- June 2010\n\nPer Section 11, the white paper's security model shows honest miners (e.g.\nfollowing standard operation) outpacing alternatives. In practice, miners\nfollowing a standardness agreement or soft fork for OP_RETURN would, on\naffected blocks, earn around $100,000 more, than under a mixed policy,\nmaking prioritizing standard transactions the economically optimal strategy.\n\nThis is because there are a finite number of blocks before each halving, so\nthe opportunity cost of non-standard payloads is half the subsidy, which is\nmore than enough economic upside to offset fees. A standardness agreement\nsoft fork is therefore economically compelling for miners: it aligns with\nlong-standing practice and provides long-term incentives.\n\nBest,\nMelvin\n\n\n>\n> Bitcoin was specifically designed to prevent censorship of transactions\n> that follow the consensus rules.

I can imagine a Script, which could allow something like\n1-of-460 multisig: if all public keys would be hashed, then it would take\n21 bytes to push any given hash. And then, pushing 460 hashes would take\n460*21=9660 bytes. Then, to clean it up, OP_2DROP would consume two\nelements, so that means 230 bytes, to clean it up with OP_2DROPs, and a\nsingle OP_DROP.\n\nI think it could be something like that:\n\nOP_TOALTSTACK <9660 bytes> OP_FROMALTSTACK OP_PICK OP_TOALTSTACK\n<OP_2DROP*229> OP_DROP\nOP_DUP OP_HASH160 OP_FROMALTSTACK OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\n\nAnd then, this is how it could be executed:\n\n<sig> <pubkey> <number>                    //input stack\n<sig> <pubkey>                             //toaltstack\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes>            //pushing hashes\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes> <number>   //pushing number\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes> <hash>     //picking hash\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes>            //toaltstack\n<sig> <pubkey>                             //dropping the rest\n<sig> <pubkey> <pubkey>                    //dup\n<sig> <pubkey> <hash>                      //hash160\n<sig> <pubkey> <hash> <hash>               //fromaltstack\n<sig> <pubkey>                             //equalverify\nOP_TRUE                                    //checksig\n\nWhich means, that it would take 9660 bytes, plus 230 bytes of dropping, so\nit sums up to 9890 bytes. Then, 9 bytes are consumed by the rest of the\nenvelope, and that leaves 101 bytes for signature and public key. Seems\ndoable.

So it appears to me that there is \noverwhelming majority support for limiting these types of \"bulk dust\" \ntransactions, as they do present a legitimate concern for node runners.\n\nConcept\n\nFlag a transaction as “bulk dust” if:\n\n   - It has >=100 outputs each below a dynamically defined TinyTx \n   threshold, and\n   - Those tiny outputs make up >=60% of all outputs in the transaction.\n\nWhen flagged, it would be considered nonstandard (relay policy) or invalid \n(if soft-forked into consensus).\n\nTinyTx threshold (dynamic halving schedule)\n\nI originally considered a constant definition of what was a \"tiny\" Tx to be \n1,000 sats... but some might still just use 1,001 sats, right? Plus there \nvery likely will be a time where there is a valid use-case of >100 outputs \nunder 1,000 sats.\n\nRather than fixing the “tiny” threshold to a constant like 1,000 sats, the \nrule defines it as a decreasing function of block height, starting high and \ngradually tightening over time.\n\n   - Starts at 4096 sats when activated (target ~2028).\n   - Halves every 210,000 blocks (~4 years).\n   - Never falls below 1 sat (hard floor).\n\nYear ---- Block Height -- TinyTx Threshold\n2028 --- ~activation ---- 4096 sats\n2032 --- ~1,260,000 ---- 2048 sats\n2036 ",

The image \nof Pepe pumping iron with \"UTXO\" on top was stored in 1,859 fake pubkeys / \nUTXOs. The proposed tiny_count of 100 would split that particular image \nacross at least 19 Txs (likely a lot more if on-chain indexing were used), \nwhich only adds at least +6% to fees, but it does ruin \"atomicity\" (images \nall-in-one Tx) by adding complexity of needing some type of index to link \nthem, causes confirmation risk, & pushes data abusers toward OP_RETURN or \nwitness space.\n\nChanging the 100 tiny_count to 50 ≈ +11% fees; to 30 ≈ +16% fees; & to 20 ≈ \n+24% fees (this only takes into account an extra 200 bytes per additional \ninput Tx and does not consider any additional indexing needs) .

My main \nfrustrations with Lightning are the need for watchtowers, and routing \ncomplexities that arise from channel liquidity limitations. I wondered if \nwe could leverage the existing mining infrastructure instead of building \nseparate systems.\n\nMy goal was to find a scaling solution that:\n\n\n   - Eliminates watchtower requirements by using miners (who are already \n   always online)\n   - Avoids channel-based routing complexities\n   - Guarantees eventual settlement\n   - Creates natural economic incentives for all participants\n\nI'm not a Bitcoin developer, but I wanted to share this concept with the \ncommunity to see if others think it could work and how it might be \nimplemented. I'm particularly interested in feedback on the technical \nfeasibility.\n\nHere's the concept:\n\n*Anticipation Pool*\n\nAnticipation transactions (ATX) are pre-signed Bitcoin transactions that \nare forwardable to anyone without immediate blockchain settlement.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nInstead of publishing transactions to the mempool to add them to the \nblockchain, you create a pre-signed ATX that goes into a special pool \ncalled the anticipation pool, managed by miners. Once enough miners have \nvalidated your ATX and added it to the pool (validation threshold to be \ndetermined, e.g., 10-30% of hashpower depending on amount), the recipient \ncan consider it \"confirmed\". Double-spending is prevented because miners \ntimestamp and validate each forward, with first-seen winning, and check \nagainst the anticipation pool, mempool and blockchain to ensure the outputs \nhaven't been spent elsewhere.\n\nThe ATX has a timelock (e.g. 30 days), during this time only the recipient \ncan publish it to the mempool, forward it to someone else (including to \nthemselves), or split it to multiple people.

My approach has been to stick with\nScript: even if you prefer other approaches, you should find this\nrestoration and enhancement of script capabilities a useful comparison.\n\nCurrent drafts in \"review me!\" format:\n\n\thttps://github.com/rustyrussell/bips/pull/1\n\nHere is a brief description of each:\n\n1. Varops Budget For Script Runtime Constraint (bip-unknown-varops-budget.mediawiki)\n\nThis extends and generalizes the sigops budget into a \"variable\noperations\" budget, using benchmarks taken from the prototype\nimplementation across various machines.  This budget is per transaction,\nby weight, designed to constrain usage to ensure rapid evaluation\nwithout overly restricting scripting ability.\n\n2. Restoration of Script Capabilities\n\nOnce the safety net of the varops budget is in place, disabled opcodes\ncan be re-enabled, stack object size and total capacity extended, and\nabitrary-length arithmetic restored (though numbers are now always\nunsigned).\n\n3. OP_TX\n\nOnce script can handle large data once more, the problem of\nintrospection is signficantly simplified: we can simply have an opcode\nwhich pushes parts of the current transaction onto the stack.  The\nconcrete design proposed here is a fruitful area for debate and review.\n\n4. New Opcodes for Tapscript v2\n\nThe most speculative part of the series suggests some opcodes which\nwould allow more optimal use of Script: OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK,\nOP_SEGMENT, OP_BYTEREV, OP_ECPOINTADD, OP_INTERNALKEY and OP_MULTI.\nSome of these are old friends, and others may be new to you: I look\nforward to your feedback.\n\nThere is also a prototype implementation we used for testing:\n\n\thttps://github.com/jmoik/bitcoin/tree/gsr\n\nThankyou in advance for your consideration!\nRusty & Julian.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Develop",

You can go even cheaper with\nsecond-hand hardware.

On my laptop our unmerged\nchanges can fully reindex in ~2 hours. And with a SwiftSync prototype I\nhave even done a reindex-chainstate on a battery-powered cheap rpi5 (+\nmonitoring over wifi) in ~3:14 hours (pi on a pi - and the batteries were\nstill 70% full): https://x.com/L0RINC/status/1972062557835088347.\nThe situ",
