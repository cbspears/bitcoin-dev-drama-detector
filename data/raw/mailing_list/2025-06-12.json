While few basic mitigations have been developed and \nshipped\nin LN implementations over the last few years, it is believed that more \nrobust\nmitigations can only be deployed at the protocol-level, thus unlikely to \nhappen\nwith an embargoed process.\n\nThis class of attacks dubbed \"fee-bumping reserves exhaustion attacks\" is\ntracked at the protocol-level by CVE-2025-27586. As as far as it is \nunderstood\nit is affecting LN routing nodes (i.e a double-spent of an incoming / \noutgoing \nHTLC) and LN payee (i.e revealing a preimage with `update_fulfill_htlc` and\ndouble-spent with a HTLC-timeout). This is indeed a money stealing kind of \nattacks.\n\nWhile the attacks have not been tested under real-world configurations, \nthey're\ndeemed as feasible, with the caveat of round guessing the level of \nfee-bumping\nreserves for the adversary (see corresponding section).

If consensus compatible forks of Bitcoin \nCore want to maintain different mempool policies, wallet features, GUIs etc \nthey are free to with no chain split risk assuming they don't accidentally \nintroduce a consensus bug which Core has made as easy to avoid as possible \nover the years. Hence we have seen Knots, Libre Relay etc introduce \ndifferent mempool policies to Core without a chain split or a split of the \nnetwork. The recent statement by Core stating what its current contributors \nprioritize when designing transaction relay policy [3] and the \ncommunication around the recent transaction relay policy pull request \n(#32404) merge decision [4] I thought was excellent. However to take that \nprecedent on Core *transaction relay policy* (a signed statement by a set \nof Core contributors and signposting around the merge decision) and assume \nit can be applied to a *consensus rule change* (CTV and CSFS or whatever \nthe current set of opcodes is currently in vogue) requesting Core \ncontributors prioritize review within 6 months is short sighted to put it \nmildly. Core can make unilateral decisions on transaction policy because \nconsensus compatible forks can have different transaction policy without \nsplitting the chain or the network. It can't make unilateral decisions on a \nconsensus rule change. If there is significant disagreement on a consensus \nrule change an attempted consensus",

After all, you're not\nmining the TX yet, just initiating a challenge phase\nto see which is the oldest committed spending TX.\nThe actual spending TX data is not necessary at this stage\nunless you want the TX to be automatically published\n(by being stored on-chain already).\n\nEither way this would be quite complicated to implement.\nNodes would have to maintain a DB which tracks the info\nneeded to validate these new spending rules.\n\nI think i still prefer Martin's commit/reveal solution\n[0] better for a few reasons. \n\n1. It doesn't require nodes keep track of commitments,\n   reveals, and counter-reveals independently of the UTXO\n   set.\n2. It's more space efficient.\n3. It requires no convoluted \"counter reveal\" stage.\n\nI realize your announcement-based approach could, in\ntheory, protect exposed pubkeys, but I see a bit of a\nproblem there.

Ideally some \n\nnew age cryptography such as lattices allows\nthis. If every Bitcoin transaction used a large\nhash-based signature like Lamport, WOTS, or \n\nSPHINCS, then L1 TPS would have to drop, or \n\nblocksize would have to increase, and nobody \n\nwants that.\n\nBut it's good to have options. WOTS not an ideal\none by any means, but it works, and assumes little\ncompared to lattices.\n\nMaybe useful as an emergency quantum-resistant\nescape hatch, in case the network doesn't come\nto consensus on  a more compact signature scheme,\nor if the novel scheme that we do use turns out\nto be insecure.\n\nBest case is that in a few years, someone\ninvents a scheme with 64 byte signatures which\nis quantum resistant, and we add a new opcode or\naddress format, and everyone migrates to that.\nBut let's not put all our eggs in one basket.\n\nPS thanks for the link Yuval, I wasn't aware of\nthat prior work.

That's most unfortunate. While this is getting silly, I can't \nhelp wondering what happens, in the presence of an ECDLP breaker, to a \nbotched version of taproot that requires script-path spending and doesn't \nallow key-path.\n\nIt's interesting, imagine: honest keyholder creates Q = P_N + H(P_N||S)G \nwhere P_N means NUMS internal key. ECDLP breaker can just find DL of Q but \nif we disallow key-path spend they have to open a hash commitment to a \ntweak as per usual taproot rules.\n\nSo they need: Q = P_2 +H(P_2||S_2)G now, they know the full private key x_N \n+ H(P_N||S) for Q (and they may or may not know S, or be able to guess it, \nto get all the variables in that expression), but it seems to not help them \ngiven the commitment to P_2 in the hash, requiring them to choose P_2 \nbefore the hash.\n\nThey could of course do it with P_N itself, if that were allowed, hence the \n\"disable NUMS\" might make sense, in this scenario. Can't say I'm 100% sure \nof myself here, but it looks like that works.\n\nEven if I'm right, it's not so interesting; we already are assuming that a \nquantum attacker can't break hashes, that's behind a lot of the discussion \nhere, so of course it would make sense if we broke taproot to require it \nonly to use hashes (script path only), then it might come back to the same \nsecurity situation (which of course, is not actual security, since keys are \nalways revealed in spending). Or maybe we should start to think of really, \nreally worst case scenarios: what if a new quantum algorithm actually does \nefficiently find SHA2 preimages? :)\n\nThanks, AdamISZ/waxwing\n\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receivi",

I will address a few \nthings you say in the article at the end, here, but first I want to discuss \nsome background related to aut-ct (and yes this is mostly already implicit \nin your article but for other readers, the following):\n\nI want to expand on something I said when we were discussing this on \ndelving [1]:\n\nThere's always in my mind two very distinct threats from Sybilling. The \nfirst is that your protocol might subtly (or grossly) depend on \nnon-collusion of participants. For that you want one kind of Sybil \nresistance.\n\nThe second is the problem of free-entry, which can occur even if \nnon-collusion is not a requirement. If anyone can join a protocol without \nreal limits, then the resource usage implied when the number of protocol \nusers increases by 1000x can screw up resource utilization. (Bitcoin itself \ndeals with this beautifully through implicit PoW dependence of messages to \nbe considered valid.)\n\nMy feeling when working on the idea of RIDDLE and then later aut-ct was \nthat I was only really addressing or thinking about the 2nd of those two \ncases. It's not impossible to use a utxo ownership proof to address the 1st \nof the two above, but it's clearly much less strong, by default, than one \nwould hope.\n\nJust a pure \"I own a utxo\" imposes no, or negligible cost. As per the \ndelving post, and in a few other places, I've noted you can impose an age \nand value restriction to bump up the cost. So it's not inconceivable but I \nsuspect it's troublesome, and, it tends to fall into the \"anything's better \nthan nothing\" category. While a fidelity bond with a public timeout is more \nconvenient specifically because you don't need to have \"prepared\" it in \nadvance, a long time (so same lockup cost, but in advance).\n\nThe actual problems with fidelity bonds are twofold: privacy headache from \npublic utxo announcement, and expense (the expense p",

I found that the discursive detail avoided some \nconfusions I had with Tim's and Adam's earlier descriptions, though there \nare clearly a ton of subtle differences in the various designs.\n\nAnyway, one detail: you have h(pubkey), h(pubkey,txid), txid. You note \nearlier that h should be tagged for domain separation purposes. But if you \nmeant literally the same h for the first two components of the tuple, \nthere's a flaw, depending on h; length extension attacks could allow the \ncreation of h(pubkey,txid') without knowing pubkey. I'm going to ignore the \ntrickier question of whether that matters based on how txid is derived from \na transaction (given txid vs wtxid, I guess it actually really does). \nPresumably just use h2 which differs from h, either a different hash or a \ndifferent prefix, to avoid this. And/or swapping h(txid,pubkey) etc. \nObviously using h() that is not susceptible to LEA avoids the Q being \nraised, but that may be more or less easy in Bitcoin-land.\n\nCheers,\nAdamISZ/waxwing\n\nOn Wednesday, May 28, 2025 at 2:28:25 PM UTC-3 Tadge Dryja wrote:\n\n> One of the tricky things about securing Bitcoin against quantum computers \n> is: do you even need to?

Yes, hand computing the checksum for BIP-93 is a pain, but\nunlike BIP-39's checksum, it is actually doable.  And unlike BIP-39's\nchecksum, the checksum for codex32 is actually an error-correcting code, so\nyou can actually repair errors and erasures in the data.

I was picturing an\narbitrary EC signature, possibly on a static message,\ne.g. sign(\"i was here first!\", sk). Not an EC signature on the\nreveal transaction, because you're right - that would be a cyclical\ndependency.\n\nI was thinking we commit to sha256(sign(static_msg, sk)) using a\nquantum-protected address in the commitment stage. In the reveal\ntransaction, we open the commitment by revealing \n\nsign(static_msg, sk), spending both the QR and EC UTXOs.\n\nHowever, I like your idea of committing to the pubkey instead of a\nsignature - it's simpler. As you said, we can't give the QC attacker\nopportunities to steal and so the commitment must be hidden until it\nis revealed when it comes time to spend the EC output. This applies\nto any kind of commit/reveal scheme, whether we use signatures or\npubkeys.\n\nThe exact mechanics will depend on what commitment mechanisms are\navailable to users of the hypothetical quantum-resistant script pubkey.\nBest case is we hope to have a taproot-like tweaking mechanism that\nlets us hide a commitment in the QR output script, or we use a P2SH\nwrapping layer around a hypothetical quantum-resistant checksig\nopcode, and hide the committed data in an inscription-like envelope\nwhich is opened by the reveal transaction.\n\n\nFor better scaling, we probably want to commit some kind of\naccumulator, rather than just a single raw hash. Otherwise you'd\nneed one QR UTXO to spend every locked EC UTXO, which isn't very\nefficient. For instance, say you have 10 locked EC utxos you want\nto rescue using a single QR output. You create a new QR output\nwhich hides a commitment to sha256(pk0, pk1, ...pk9) (or a merkle\ntree root of same). This way, a single QR ",

Schoolbook Winternitz\none-time signatures, forest-of-trees few-time signatures, and Merkle trees\nall validate signatures (/authentication paths) by recomputing the public\nkey (/Merkle tree root) from the signature and the message, and checking\nwhether the recomputed public key matches the actual public key. That means\nwe can pick anything for the signature, and just set the public key to the\nrecomputed public key.\n\nThe situation is more subtle for actual standardized hash-based signatures.\nRFC 8391 XMSS doesn’t sign the message itself, but first hashes in (among\nothers) the public key. Basically the best we can do for XMSS (except for\nsetting the signature randomizer) is to guess the public key. Thus it’s\npretty much jpeg resistant.\n\nThe situation is different again for RFC 8391 XMSSMT. XMSSMT is basically a\ncertificate chain of XMSS signatures. An XMSSMT public key is an XMSS\npublic key. An XMSSMT signature is a chain of XMSS signatures: the XMSSMT\npublic key signs another XMSS public key; which signs another public XMSS\npublic key; …; which signs the message. Again the top XMSSMT public key is\nhashed into the message signed, but that only binds the first XMSS\nsignature. We can’t mess with the first signature, but the other signatures\nwe can choose freely, as those roots are not bound. Thus XMSSMT with two\nsubtrees is only half jpeg resistant and it gets worse with more subtrees.\n\nSimilarly SLH-DSA (FIPS 205, née SPHINCS+) is a certificate chain of (a\nvariant of) XMSS signing another XMSS public key, which si",

I realize that you don’t know me, and I can only say that my position is also established with the same intentions.  With that said, I don’t think these types of services are a threat at all.  I think they are essential to a healthy mining network where miners can have some control over a portion of their future revenue streams, especially in the greatly reduced subsidy era we are about to enter.  And, I think the lack of a futures/forward market for blockspace is a major inhibitor to adoption and usage.  Its hard to build a business where access to block space is a necessity without any visibility to the future.  I believe this can be done in a manner that provides openness and transparency, and it would also give us for the first time visibility to future demand and pricing and I think that will be valuable to the enter ecosystem.

Whether I would be considered major or not can be judged by others.\n\nThat said, I suggest being very careful about projecting the current behavior of major miners as the norm or representative of the future.  We are extremely early in the development of the mining industry and there is a high likelihood that over the next few years that there will a dramatic change in the list of major miners – and there very well may be changes in the philosophies and priorities of these miners as well.\n\nI spent most of career in the personal computer industry going back to ’86 (most notably as the CTO of Gateway) and I learned many things from my experience.  One important thing was that the pace with which companies could rise to or fall from prominence was jaw-dropping.  Assuming that “major miners” was meant to mean a group that largely is comprised of pubcos, none of the major players in the mining industry have been doing it for long - with most going public very recently (’22 and ’23).   They but pups as companies and we’ve already seen a huge flameout or two.  The next three to five years will likely result in a few more flameouts and some large new entrants that may approach mining from a completely different perspective.  A second learning I will share from my PC development days was that predicting usages and user behavior is next to impossible.  The safest and most accommodating path is to give as much user optionality/configurability as possible.  My high-level recommendation is to work on paths that give users more choice not less.  This is applies to OP_RETURN but, even more importantly, I think it is the best design direction in general.\n\nTo offer what may be a new lens in which to view miners, I’ll share a bit of my philosophy and vision for my company.

One of those shortcomings was the difficulty reset creating havoc. [0] In spite of this a similar rule was adopted for testnet4. [1] As a result, testnet4 is similarly creating havoc. [2]\n\nThe goal of testnet is to mimic the Bitcoin mainnet. This is why it is useful to have in addition to a more control testing environment such as Signet.\n\nThe given rationale for a difficulty reset was to let developers occasionally mine blocks on their laptop. But you cannot have your cake and eat it too: either the network is permissionless (PoW) or you assign identities and privileges to some (Signet). By trying to do both at the same time testnet4 created a loophole for abuse. As a result it failed on both count: it neither mimics mainnet nor allows developers to mine active blocks on their laptop.\n\nI propose to fix this by removing the difficulty reset rule from testnet4 through a flag day hard fork on 2026-01-01. I picked a date well in the future to minimize disruption. This leaves enough time for a patch to be reviewed, merged, included in the next major Bitcoin Core release, backported to previous releases and adopted by the infrastructure running on testnet4. That should be enough for a test network.\n\nLet me know what you think,\nAntoine\n\n[0] https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CADL_X_eXjbRFROuJU0b336vPVy5Q2RJvhcx64NSNPH-3fDCUfw@mail.gmail.com\n[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0094.mediawiki#rule-specification\n[2] [https://fork.observer](https://fork.observer/) - pick the network on the top right corner\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/hU75",

So either way I would close out this question.\n\nIt would make more sense to me to have the project(s) that have deployed such hard forks finally BIP all of them, as some have been deployed silently. This would allow all implementations to know what the consensus might actually be (or not) without having to fish through source code repos.\n\nAt least one of these supposedly inert hard forks (silently deployed) has resulted in a very likely future chain split, which the Consensus Cleanup effort is attempting to mitigate. Interestingly enough it pertains directly to bip30.\n\nAt least this way various projects and their consumers can make informed decisions about how they perceive the risk and the benefit. Some might simply take BC at its word (that removing checkpoints is unlikely to cause a chain split) and simply ignore it.\n\ne\n\n> On May 10, 2025, at 12:24, Sjors Provoost <sjors@sprovoost•nl> wrote:\n> \n> ﻿Hi Eric,\n> \n> I agree that deep-reorg BIP30 handling is not important.

The idea of delegating one’s coins is not a new one. Some \nspeculate <https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/op_codeseparator/> that OP_\nCODESEPARATOR was an early attempt by Satoshi to do delegation. More \nrecently, proposals like Graftroot \n<https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CAAS2fgSnfd++94+40vnSRxQfi9fk8N6+2-DbjVpssHxFvYveFQ@mail.gmail.com/>\n and Entroot <https://gist.github.com/sipa/ca1502f8465d0d5032d9dd2465f32603>\n have been put forward, which would enable delegation (and re-delegation), \nbut only from key path spends and only to a locking script. In contrast, \nCSFS <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0348.md> would enable \ndelegation from script path spends, but it's limited, as it only \nfacilitates delegation within a pre-committed script.\n\nWhen considering delegation, what type of functionality is desirable? I’d \nargue that generalized delegation has two properties:\n\n   1. Delegation *from any valid spending path*\n   2. Delegation *to arbitrarily complex compositions of programs and \n   script*\n\nThe latter is important so that users can delegate to *addresses*, and not \njust public keys, while retaining the ability to add timelocks and other \nconditions.\n\nIn order to build this, we need two key features: 1) \"Generalized \nComposition,\" and 2) \"Generalized Delegation.\" Generalized composition \ninvolves the conjunction of programs and script, and delegation is merely \nthe addition of a second composition on-the-fly, if the primary one is \nsatisfied.\n\nIs there a simple and safe way to implement generalized composition and \ndelegation within Taproot? I think there is...\n\nI’d like to present a proof-of-concept that I came up with, wh",

All other inputs/outputs are\nefficiently crossed off inside a single hash aggregate that only reaches\nzero if validation was successful and the hints were correct.\n\nThe main observation is that it can be much easier to validate that a given\nUTXO set is correct than to compute it yourself. It allows us to no longer\nrequire a stateful moment-to-moment UTXO set during IBD and allows\neverything to be order independent. I'll briefly summarize the protocol,\nbefore sharing the link to the full write-up.\n\nEach output gets a boolean hint (e.g. committed into Bitcoin Core) about\nwhether or not it will still be in the UTXO set after validation completes.\nIf it does, we write it to disk (append-only - it won't be used until\nSwiftSync finishes). If it does not, we hash the UTXO data and add it to an\naggregate. For each input, we once again hash the UTXO data and remove it\nfrom the aggregate.\n\nAt the end, for every added output there should have been exactly one\nremoved input, bringing the end total of the aggregate to zero. If this is\nindeed the case, we will have validated that the hints, and the resulting\nUTXO set, were correct.\n\nE.g. For spent outputs A, B and inputs C, D we calculate hash(UTXO_A||salt)\n+ hash(UTXO_B||salt) - hash(UTXO_C||salt) - hash(UTXO_D||salt) == 0\n(proving (A==C && B==D) || (A==D && B==C)).\n\nThere is one missing step. The UTXO data is only available when processing\nthe output, but not when processing the input. We resolve this by either\ndownloading the outputs that were spent for each block (equivalent to the\nundo data, maybe 10-15% of a block), or we lean on assumevalid, making it\nsufficient to only hash the outpoints (which are available in both the\noutput and input) rather than the full UTXO da",

Obviously CTR mode would be unsuitable! (I mean sure modular add/sub and xor are different operations but they are quite close).  I think that in many modes the collision resistance would have to at least be restricted by the birthday bound with the small block size. I think CMC might be needed to avoid that sort of issue.\n\nCan Haraka V2 [1] hash function be used? It is based on AES and\nsupports 256 or 512 bit inputs. UTXO (txid + index) has a fixed size\nand fits into 320 bits. We can use the 512 bit version and just leave\nthe remaining bytes zero.\n\n[1] https://github.com/kste/haraka\n\n-- \nBest regards,\nBoris Nagaev\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/CAFC_Vt6BgUFt5%2BzbSKzHyN4Sk1nFw5hbXVcv_jdUzA5RJvwFBg%40mail.gmail.com.",
