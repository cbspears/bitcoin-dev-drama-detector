Consolidation of inputs\nis often bad for privacy and makes silent payments, coinjoin etc. useless\nin some cases however the user has the choice to select coins manually\nwhile transacting. In payjoin, users can't do much about it.

However, if\nswapped coins are used in transactions, octojoin could be a better solution\nwhich doesn't require any inputs from the recipient.\n\n> I'm not sure what you mean by \"the recipient would never doubt it\n> because it's a privacy tool\", it sounds to me like this is mainly a\n> criticism of the UX of payjoin supporting wallets, or of wallets in\n> general for not educating users that privacy is not a binary thing?\n\nThe recipient would never doubt a sender who insists on using payjoin and\nnot interested in a normal bitcoin transaction.

Let luck decide, right? But I\nworry it’d turn into a mess. If quantum machines start cracking keys and\nsnagging coins, it’s not just lost Satoshi-era stuff at risk.

Freezing funds after a heads-up period (say, four years) protects\nthat idea better than letting tech giants or rogue states play vampire with\nour network. It also nudges people to get their act together and move to\nsafer addresses, which strengthens Bitcoin long-term.\nSaulo’s right that freezing coins could confuse folks or spark a split like\nEthereum Classic.

Bitcoin’s fixed bugs\nbefore, like SegWit. This feels like that, not a bailout.\nSo yeah, I’d rather see vulnerable coins locked than handed to whoever\nbuilds the first quantum rig.

A covenant is a set of rules about what transactions can\nspend a Bitcoin output which is encumbered by that covenant. Typically\na covenant is enforced by preventing someone from spending that\noutput. In this protocol we instead allow the spending of the output\nand then punish the spender by a loss of funds, i.e. we slash them, if\nthey do not follow the rules of the covenant. This is less secure than\na covenant enforced by an opcode, FE or ColliderScript, because it\nrelies on incentives over enforcement. The advantage of this approach\nis that it is efficient, does not add new cryptographic assumptions\nand is possible on Bitcoin today.\n\nThis protocol uses very similar mechanisms to BitVM, originally I\nthought this was how BitVM worked, which is why I didn’t publish it.\nAfter talking to many people it appears this technique is not used in\nBitVM.\n\n\nNotation\n====\nBy <x>32 we denote a value, x, in Bitcoin Script which is encoded as a\nlist of 32-bit stack elements. We can perform arbitrary computation on\nsuch values using Bitcoin’s math opcodes, a.k.a., Small Script.\n\nProtocol\n====\nThe essential problem for enforcing covenants in Bitcoin outputs is\nshowing that a signature s1 that will pass CHECKSIGVERIFY is equal to\na signature s2 encoded for Small Script. This is because once we get a\nsignature into Small Script, we extract the sighash and do transaction\nintrospection. ColliderScript gets us covenants by using hash\ncollisions to check equality between s1 and <s2>32. CAT gets us\ncovenants by simply concatenating all the <s2>32 and then comparing\nagainst s1 using EQUAL:\n\ns2 = CAT(<s2>32 [0], <s2>32 [1],  <s2>32 [2], … <s2>32 [15])\nEQUAL s1, s2\n\nSlashing covenants works by removing the requirement for this equality\ncheck, but instead providing a fraud proof ifs1!=s2, and posting that\nfraud proof to punish the spending party.

Most likely we'll get\nsome tag-length-value encoding scheme.\n\nApplications already using annexes who want to also take advantage of\nnew consensus features will of course have to upgrade their encoding\nschemes to match.

Just rejecting blocks with \ndifficulty=1, and requiring always a block with the true network \ndifficulty, is a valid soft-fork.\n\nTo better see that, you can imagine, what would happen, if someone would \napply difficulty adjustment rule on mainnet. Then, it would be possible to \ntemporarily mine a block on a CPU, see it confirmed by your node (and \nrejected by the rest of the network), and then, when the next real block \nwould appear, your client would automatically switch to a stronger chain \n(and then, those CPU-mined blocks would be truly worthless).\n\nSo, I assume if you change \"fPowAllowMinDifficultyBlocks\" from \"true\" to \n\"false\", when block time will be greater than unix time \"1767225600\", then \nyou will get a valid soft-fork. Non-upgraded clients could then still see \nsome CPU-mined blocks, but they will disappear, if the hashrate majority \nwill support your changes, and then old clients will automatically follow \nyour chain. Also note that a single ASIC block can reorg a lot of CPU-mined \nblocks, so it is always guaranteed, that this change will be \nchainwork-compatible.\n\nwtorek, 18 marca 2025 o 22:24:49 UTC+1 Antoine Poinsot napisał(a):\n\n> Hi,\n>\n> Testnet4 was rolled out a year ago to address the shortcomings of \n> testnet3.

If PQC signatures aren't added, such as with BIP-360, there will be some concern around long exposure attacks on P2TR coins.\n\nThere were literally millions of BTC locked in outputs whose public keys are already known to the public, long before P2TR. Either because of they're in P2PK outputs, because they're in hashed addresses which have been reused and already using for spending, or because they're been spent in forked chains. There are likely substantially more BTC in outputs whose public keys are known to multiple parties (multisig, lightning channels, escrow services, ...) but not to the entire world.\n\nI certainly agree there is no urgency right now, but if (and only if) cryptography-breaking QCs become a reality, the ecosystem has no choice but disabling(*) the spending of coins through schemes that become broken, and n",

In such a scenario, it could be highly beneficial for parties that benefit from high fees to flood the network with bogus transactions to force the fees arbitrarily high, since people would then be forced to either pay exorbitant fees to move their funds by the deadline, or lose their funds entirely. As such, this does not seem like a good idea in general, at least unless the transition period is extremely long (say 10 years or more).\n\nA less drastic proposal could be to (at least initially) only disable spending from the less common outputs that have no inherent quantum resistance by virtue of having a hashed public key, such as P2PK and P2TR, while leaving the safer variants with hashed public keys like P2PKH and P2WPKH spendable. Most analyses of quantum algorithms I have read suggest that at least initially, they would take a significant amount of time to calculate a private key even if the public key is known, which means that even if there were a quantum breakthrough, there should be a relatively low chance of having funds intercepted between broadcasting it (which would of course reveal the public key) and having it included in a block. Furthermore, there would always be the option of only revealing the transaction to a trusted miner rather than broadcasting it, foregoing the risk entirely.\n\nUTXOs with hashed public keys might still need to be disabled at some point, seeing as a non-insignificant number of them have a revealed public key due to address reuse, and that quantum computers might eventually reach the point where the chance of breaking a private key after broadcasting but before block inclusion is non-insignificant, but this should at least alleviate the initial rush of disabling everything at once.\n\n--\nBest,\nArmchairCryptologist\n\nOn Sunday, March 9th, 202",

These schemes exhibit significant storage overheads, hindering \ntheir practical application. This paper introduces ESSPI, an optimized \nmethod leveraging ECDSA/Schnorr signatures to sign the BitVMX program \ninput. With Schnorr signatures we achieve an optimal 1:1 data expansion, \ncompared to the current known best ratio of 1:200 based on Winternitz \nsignatures. To accomplish this we introduce 4 innovations to BitVMX: (1) a \nmodification of the BitVMX CPU, adding a challengeable hashing core to it, \n(2) a new partition-based search to detect fraud during hashing, (3) a new \nenhanced transaction DAG with added data-carrying transactions with a \nfraud-verifying smart-contract and (4) a novel timelock-based method for \nproving data availability to Bitcoin smart contracts. The enhanced BitVMX \nprotocol enables the verification of uncompressed inputs such as SPV \nproofs, NiPoPoWs, or longer computation integrity proofs, such as STARKs.\n\nBest, Sergio.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/3e49d257-7d44-4c19-a157-eb479ca0a4b9n%40googlegroups.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #1.2: Type: text/html, Size: 2146 bytes --]",

The proposed improvements are motivated\nfor diverse reasons detailed subsequently. Currently, there has been 2 draft\nBIPs proposed [0] [1]. A modular overhaul of the transaction-relay protocol\nwas already discussed few years ago [2].\n\n## Problems\n\nAs a reminder, the Bitcoin transaction-relay protocol in its simple flow \n(i.e\nno package and no erlay) for inter-node single transaction communication \nworks\nin the following rough way:\n- a wallet do an initial broadcast of a new tx to a node A\n- node A do an INV(MSG_TX, TXID) message to node B\n- node B replies with GETDATA(MSG_TX, TXID)\n- node A forwards the new transaction with a TX message\n\nAs far as I know, the transaction-relay protocol as work in the following\nway since the very first releases of the original bitcoin software. There is\nindeed a myriad of other subtleties that have been added in the time, for \ngood\nreasons, here go to see a full-node codebase.\n\nThis approach comes up with a number of practical problems.\n\n## 1. Transaction-Relay as Denial-of-Service Vector\n\nThere could be scenarios where puppets peers are deliberately sending junk\ntransactions traffic that is burdening a target node CPU time [3] [4]. In my\nunderstanding, this is not necessarily one of the most concerning DoS risk\naffecting Bitcoin full-nodes partaking in in the transaction-relay network,\nhowever this can be still concerning.\n\n## 2. Transaction-Propagation Deanonymization Vector\n\nSome gap in the current transaction-relay protocol allows mass-connectors\nto broadcast transactions without first sending an INV message. Indeed, \ncurrent\nbitcoin core software accepts a raw TX message, even if has not been paired \nby\nan INV or asked for by a GETDATA. Exploiting this behavior, mass-connectors\ncan bypass tx-relay timers to gather more information on the \ntransaction",

That gives you an efficient \nrepresentation, compatibility with other software, a compact checksum, \nand local policy.\n\nFor the later point, policy being local, there exists software[1] that I \nbelieve has a moderate userbase (including possibly some miner support) \nthat implements less restrictive standard transaction rules than Bitcoin \nCore, specifically allowing OP_RETURN outputs of more than 83 bytes \ncumulative.[2]  If a user of your software runs that node and believes \nhis transactions will relay to a compatible miner, what options does he \nhave of circumventing BOSD type 0's limit of 80 push bytes if one of his \nusers wants to send him such a data carrier output?  He can propose a \ntype 5, but you'll probably reject that because >80 bytes will be \nnon-standard for other users.  You can create an extension numeric \nrange, but then you'll have to centrally coordinate number assignment \nfor every random proposal.  Instead, I think it makes more sense to not \nuse versioning at all and just perform local verification on raw() \ndescriptors; that way users of your software can modify one line of code \non their side to accept >80 bytes and everyone else can use the default \ntests.\n\nIn addition to the above technical criticism, I find the BOSD name \nextremely conflationary with the longstanding use of \"output script \ndescripto",

The prior times that I \ninvestigated this claim, transactions with feerates lower than \n`minTxRelayFee` exclusively appeared at the front of the block, \nindicating that they were explicitly prioritized by the miner, probably \ndue to out-of-band payment. You may now also find some TRUC transactions \nwhere a low-feerate parent is carried by a higher feerate child. Neither \nof these two indicates that a miner has configured a lower `-blockmintxfee`.\nYou could convince me that a miner has configured a lower \n`-blockmintxfee` by showing us a block that includes transactions with \nfeerates below `minTxRelayFee` appearing in the organic descending \nfeerate order.\n\nOn 2025-01-31 08:43, Greg Tonoski wrote:\n > I can't see how minrelaytxfee=0.00000001 could increase risk of DoS\n > attack or make it significantly cheaper or more effective.

Same answer in 2024 when they formalized CRYSTALS-Dilithium, \nCRYSTALS-KYBER and SPHINCS+. At the end they again say, \" NIST is also \ndeveloping a FIPS that specifies a digital signature algorithm derived from \nFALCON as an additional alternative to these standards.\" \nhttps://csrc.nist.gov/News/2024/postquantum-cryptography-fips-approved\n\nIf it takes 1.5-3 years to get the entire ecosystem of software updated, \ntested, implemented and then allow users to migrate to quantum safety, then \nBitcoin code is future proofed. It will still require months (if BTC blocks \nnormal transactions) to years (as a supported address type but not \nrequired) in order to migrate the wallets to safety. The longer the quantum \nresistant upgrade is delayed, the harsher the migration will need to \nbecome. \n\nAlice and Bob recently announced a new algorithm that breaks ECC-256 in 9 \nhours with 127k qubits. \nhttps://alice-bob.com/blog/computing-256-bit-elliptic-curve-logarithm-in-9-hours-with-126133-cat-qubits/ The \nalgorithms will continue to improve and the costs will continue to go down. \nWhile some people are very confident what the quantum hardware will look \nlike in 3 years, can they be so confident about the algorithms? We have \nswitched from supercomputer to network node method of growing quantum \ncalculations. Parallel instead of Serial. Fault tolerant algorithms that \nprefetch results. Can we really be as confident about the algorithms as \npeople seem to be about the hardware not being ready? Most people in \nquantum computing aren't aware of how much their competition has \nprogressed, how can devs who don't read 10 or 50 new quantum computing \npapers per week be more confident than the people who do?\n\nOn Wednesday, January 1, 2025 at 1:25:24 PM UTC+1 David A.
