          "body": "[-- Attachment #1: Type: text/plain, Size: 3481 bytes --]\n\nHi everyone,\n\nSwiftSync is a new validation method that allows for near-stateless, fully\nparallelizable validation of the Bitcoin blockchain via hints about which\noutputs remain unspent (<100MB total). All other inputs/outputs are\nefficiently crossed off inside a single hash aggregate that only reaches\nzero if validation was successful and the hints were correct.\n\nThe main observation is that it can be much easier to validate that a given\nUTXO set is correct than to compute it yourself. It allows us to no longer\nrequire a stateful moment-to-moment UTXO set during IBD and allows\neverything to be order independent. I'll briefly summarize the protocol,\nbefore sharing the link to the full write-up.\n\nEach output gets a boolean hint (e.g. committed into Bitcoin Core) about\nwhether or not it will still be in the UTXO set after validation completes.\nIf it does, we write it to disk (append-only - it won't be used until\nSwiftSync finishes). If it does not, we hash the UTXO data and add it to an\naggregate. For each input, we once again hash the UTXO data and remove it\nfrom the aggregate.\n\nAt the end, for every added output there should have been exactly one\nremoved input, bringing the end total of the aggregate to zero. If this is\nindeed the case, we will have validated that the hints, and the resulting\nUTXO set, were correct.\n\nE.g. For spent outputs A, B and inputs C, D we calculate hash(UTXO_A||salt)\n+ hash(UTXO_B||salt) - hash(UTXO_C||salt) - hash(UTXO_D||salt) == 0\n(proving (A==C && B==D) || (A==D && B==C)).\n\nThere is one missing step. The UTXO data is only available when processing\nthe output, but not when processing the input. We resolve this by either\ndownloading the outputs that were spent for each block (equivalent to the\nundo data, maybe 10-15% of a block), or we lean on assumevalid, making it\nsufficient to only hash the outpoints (which are available in both the\noutput and input) rather than the full UTXO da",

Not removing the checkpoints is one way of ensuring\n> the consensus bug cannot be triggered.\n\nIt's more than that. We are contemplating a \"consensus bug\" that would cause a chain split because the BIP30 exceptions are no longer being covered by any checkpoint. The heights at which this would cause a split are well below all but 3 of the 14 checkpoints. For that to occur 11 formerly checkpointed blocks would first have to be popped, given the existence of a stronger chain capable of triggering the above bug. This implies 11 more chain splits, depending at which point nodes adopted the checkpoint soft fork(s), just to reach this bug, and up to 14 possible in total. It makes no sense to fix this bug without first fixing chain splits that would be triggered *over 200,000 blocks less deep* than this BIP30 bug. And the only way to fix those is to not remove the checkpoints - which renders this bug inert.\n\n> I'm agnostic about whether having\n> checkpoints is also a reason to forgo consensus checks such as BIP30 (or my\n> proposed alternative of checking the coinbase TXID for uniqueness and\n> ensuring no future collision).\n\nThere is certainly a reason, the checkpoints are consensus rules.\n\n> Even though checkpoints essentially force your node to halt if something were invalid up until that point, \n\nRight, if any other rule conflicted with them then the chain would stall forever at that point. That is not the applied meaning of these rules. The checkpoints declare that the blocks are required and therefore inherently valid. The reason we are having this conversation is the contemplated removal of the checkpoints, which also implies that other validation within covered blocks is not consensus.\n\n> I still think there is value in being able to verify that the rules were followed.\n\nLike them or not, checkpoints are the rules that are required to be",

Tim Ruffing, Yannick\nSeurin and I recently published DahLIAS, the first interactive aggregate\nsignature scheme with constant-size signatures (64 bytes) compatible with\nsecp256k1.\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2025/692.pdf\n\nRecall that in an aggregate signature scheme, each signer contributes their own\nmessage, which distinguishes it from multi- and threshold signatures, where all\nsigners sign the same message. This makes aggregate signature schemes the\nnatural cryptographic primitive for cross-input signature aggregation because\neach transaction input typically requires signing a different message.\n\nPrevious candidates for constant-size aggregate signatures either:\n- Required cryptographic assumptions quite different from the discrete logarithm\n   problem on secp256k1 currently used in Bitcoin signatures (e.g., groups with\n   efficient pairings).\n- Were \"folklore\" constructions, lacking detailed descriptions and security\n   proofs.\n\nBesides presenting DahLIAS, the paper provides a proof that a class of these\nfolklore constructions are indeed secure if the signer does _not_ use key\ntweaking (e.g., no Taproot commitments or BIP 32 derivation). Moreover, we show\nthat there exists a concrete attack against a folklore aggregate signature\nscheme derived from MuSig2 when key tweaking is used.\n\nIn contrast, DahLIAS is proven to be compatible with key tweaking. Moreover, it\nrequires two rounds of communication for signing, where the first round can be\nrun before the messages to be signed are known. Verification of DahLIAS\nsignatures is asymptotically twice as fast as half-aggregate Schnorr signatures\nand as batch verification of individual Schnorr signatures.\n\nWe believe DahLIAS offers an attractive building block for a potential CISA\nproposal and welcome any feedback or discussion.\n\nJonas Nick, Tim Ruffing, Yannick Seurin\n\n\n[0] See, e.",

We get public data to know how many coins are using the post-quantum \nsecured scheme. Allow better informed decisions on adoptions, planning, and \nunderstanding sentiment on the perceived threat.\n2. would have clean separation for users to know whether or not their \naddress is PQC secured.\n3. for people not worried about it, they wouldn't feel arm-bar'd into \nhaving longer descriptors and an unnecessary leaf.\n4. *unsure here*, but possible that library and wallet developers could \ntreat this with cleaner separation uX, UI and not worry about (legacy-tr) \nvs (pqc-tr) descriptions and script code. (To help users differentiate)\n5. We wouldn't need to worry about some roll out period or flag day where \nthe leafs become necessary or an enabled spend path.\n\nGiven that pqc transactions will likely require additional space and \ncomputational resources, we should be cautious about heavily incentivizing \nuncertain approaches (i.e. it may be advantageous to decide on something \nbefore having certainty about the optimal approach).

Freezing funds after a heads-up period (say, four years) protects\nthat idea better than letting tech giants or rogue states play vampire with\nour network.

But I think that's fine.\n\nYes, I agree. I believe there is one more thing to falicitate any future\npotential encoding scheme transition for application.\n\nI.e you have the 1-byte : 0x00 | <random_payload_data>, and you could\nhave a an application-only versioning of the <random_payload_data> with\none more 1-byte, to give the evolvability to application to experiment\nwith multiple parsing format.\n\nSo you would have \"1-byte\" 0x00 | \"random_payload_data\" where \n\"random_payload_data\"\nis defined as 1-byte: <version_number> | \"random_payload_data\". That\nversion number shall only have application meaning, no consensus, it's\njust some kind of clear domain separation. AFAICT, the version number\ncould be always retrofitted for a non-0x00 tag-length-value consensus\nmeaning.\n\nIf it can be useful in any way, an old annex branch with a try of TLV:\nhttps://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/commit/84a897feb20c7df813e236d6bf98b69e241a4530\n\nIMHO, this was a very positive thing for taproot to have a lot of\nversioning and upgradeability paths (e.g leaves version, pubkey type, etc).\n\n> There is a possibility of a multi-party, annex-using, protocol where\n> someone does a pinning attack by re-signing their transaction with a\n> bigger annex.

However, replacing testnet3 with \ntestnet4, by just dropping support for the old network, should not be \ncalled \"reset\", but rather \"abandon\". So, the question is: should we mine a \nnew Genesis Block, at height one, on top of the current Genesis Block from \ntestnet3, and trigger the biggest possible chain reorganization, where the \nwhole chain is reorged in a backward-compatible way?\n\nAlso I wonder, if that method of introducing testnet5, by doing it on top \nof testnet4's Genesis Block is worth considering.

Wait until it has \ncompletely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on \nmacOS)\nor `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL \nis\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be \nmigrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n\nCompatibility\n==============\n\nBitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the\nLinux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+. Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\n\nNotable changes\n===============\n\n### P2P and Network Changes\n\n- Support for UPnP was dropped. If you want to open a port automatically,\n  consider using the `-natpmp` option instead, which uses PCP or NAT-PMP\ndepending on router support. (#31130)\n\n- libnatpmp was replaced with a built-in implementation of PCP and NAT-PMP\n  (still enabled using the `-natpmp` option). This supports automatic IPv4 \nport\nforwarding as well as IPv6 pinholing. (#30043)\n\n- When the `-port` configuration option is used, the default onion listening\n  port will now be derived to be that port + 1 instead of being set to a \nfixed\nvalue (8334 on mainnet).

PQ signatures are far cheaper to validate per byte\nand according to BIP-360 Falcon is cheaper than edDSA per signature\nverification.\n\nEdDSA Cycles to verify: 130,000\nFALCON-512 Cycles to verify: 81,036\n\nThis is one of the reasons I am very optimistic that Bitcoin will move\nto post-quantum signatures.

If you can prove that P is the same in both\ntransactions thus the balance and authentication properties are\nmaintained. However I think what you have described is the shape of\nthe problem we need to solve.\n\nConsider transactions: T1, T1', T2, T3, T4, T5\nwhere T1 and T1' are double spends, i.e., spend the same output to\ndifferent outputs. If half the mempool aggregates TA = (T1, T2, T3)\nand the other half aggregates TB = (T1', T4, T5). TA and TB are\nmutually exclusive and transactions are needlessly dropped on the\nfloor.

It is based on the secp256k1 implementation in the Bitcoin Core test\nframework.\n\nOur goal was to avoid including yet another custom Python implementation of the\nsecp256k1 curve in the ChillDKG reference code. Several existing BIPs (340, 324,\n327, and 352) already contain custom and sometimes subtly diverging\nimplementations of secp256k1. This library aims to provide a single, consistent\ninterface for secp256k1-related cryptographic specifications.\n\nAt the moment, secp256k1lab is included in the ChillDKG repository as a subtree.\nIt remains an open question what would be the best approach for including ChillDKG\n(with the secp256k1lab dependency) into the bips repository [1].\n\nWe welcome your feedback and contributions to this project.\n\nBest regards,\nThe current secp256k1lab maintainers: Sebastian Falbesoner, Jonas Nick, Tim\nRuffing\n\n[0] https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg\n[1] https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/HE3HSnGTpoQ/m/Y2VhaMCrCAAJ\n     (We renamed secp256k1proto to secp256k1lab)\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/d0044f9c-d974-43ca-9891-64bb60a90f1f%40gmail.com.",

In the meantime I was also thinking of a scheme that\nallows you to commit early and then wait for a any time you want but with\nthe ability to detect that someone else is trying to spend it, so that you\ncan act quickly. In some sense it was more similar but still not that good.\nThe proposed scheme with unique decommitment is better and should be\nimplemented instead of my idea.\n\nAnyway, I believe even my weaker idea is still good enough to make my point\ngiven how hard it is to censor a transaction. My point wasn't saying that\nmy specific implementation is the best but saying we can postpone the\ndecision to implement a QR scheme to much later than what some people might\nthink.\n\nHave a nice day!\n\nMartin\n\nDňa ne 30. 3. 2025, 17:41 David A.

Consolidation of inputs\nis often bad for privacy and makes silent payments, coinjoin etc. useless\nin some cases however the user has the choice to select coins manually\nwhile transacting. In payjoin, users can't do much about it. They have to\nshare UTXOs in response to the original PSBT along with the address to\nreceive bitcoin.\n\n> In the payjoin setting, the receiver is\n> using coinswap in that manner, then as a payjoin receiver they can\n> elect to only use coinswapped coins as contributed inputs to payjoin\n> transactions.\n\nIt could be a workaround or temporary fix for this problem. However, if\nswapped coins are used in transactions, octojoin could be a better solution\nwhich doesn't require any inputs from the recipient.\n\n> I'm not sure what you mean by \"the recipient would never doubt it\n> because it's a privacy tool\", it sounds to me like this is mainly a\n> criticism of the UX of payjoin supporting wallets, or of wallets in\n> general for not educating users that privacy is not a binary thing?\n\nThe recipient would never doubt a sender who insists on using payjoin and\nnot interested in a normal bitcoin transaction. They would not know the\nintentions of the sender before payjoin.\n\n> Note that in all of these specifications of payjoin UTXO probing is\n> not costless since the sender must send a fully signed transaction in\n> order to learn such a UTXO, and this transaction although not\n> confirmed still imposes a fee cost on the sender if broadcast (even if\n> it is replaced).\n\nIt was costless in the demo which could be fixed by bullbitcoin.

A covenant is a set of rules about what transactions can\nspend a Bitcoin output which is encumbered by that covenant. Typically\na covenant is enforced by preventing someone from spending that\noutput. In this protocol we instead allow the spending of the output\nand then punish the spender by a loss of funds, i.e. we slash them, if\nthey do not follow the rules of the covenant. This is less secure than\na covenant enforced by an opcode, FE or ColliderScript, because it\nrelies on incentives over enforcement. The advantage of this approach\nis that it is efficient, does not add new cryptographic assumptions\nand is possible on Bitcoin today.\n\nThis protocol uses very similar mechanisms to BitVM, originally I\nthought this was how BitVM worked, which is why I didn’t publish it.\nAfter talking to many people it appears this technique is not used in\nBitVM.\n\n\nNotation\n====\nBy <x>32 we denote a value, x, in Bitcoin Script which is encoded as a\nlist of 32-bit stack elements. We can perform arbitrary computation on\nsuch values using Bitcoin’s math opcodes, a.k.a., Small Script.\n\nProtocol\n====\nThe essential problem for enforcing covenants in Bitcoin outputs is\nshowing that a signature s1 that will pass CHECKSIGVERIFY is equal to\na signature s2 encoded for Small Script. This is because once we get a\nsignature into Small Script, we extract the sighash and do transaction\nintrospection. ColliderScript gets us covenants by using hash\ncollisions to check equality between s1 and <s2>32. CAT gets us\ncovenants by simply concatenating all the <s2>32 and then comparing\nagainst s1 using EQUAL:\n\ns2 = CAT(<s2>32 [0], <s2>32 [1],  <s2>32 [2], … <s2>32 [15])\nEQUAL s1, s2\n\nSlashing covenants works by removing the requirement for this equality\ncheck, but instead providing a fraud proof ifs1!=s2, and posting that\nfraud proof to punish the spending party.

Could this make the approach more practical?\n\nYou could use this as a separate mechanism to get covenants and then\nuse those covenants in BitVM. Is that useful to BitVM, I don't know,\nsomeone who is a BitVM expert can supply a better answer.\n\n> Does this absolutely require OP_CAT to work?\n\nThis does not require OP_CAT to work at all. It works today.\n\n> What is the rough size of such a transaction?\n\nSHA256 costs about 211kb of small script per compression function call\n[0]. I think, if you are clever, you might be able to get away with\nonly one compression function call rather than two. Not sure how big\nthe ECC math would be. We could merklize some of the computation via\ntapleaf, but probably at least a few hundred kilobytes.\n\nThat said, this huge slash transaction is only postable if the party\nwho vouched for the covenant spend cheats. The large size is actually\na feature not a bug to ensure the stake is burned rather than\nreclaimed.\n\n[0]: https://github.com/TomerStarkware/BitVM/tree/tomer/main\n\nOn Mon, Mar 24, 2025 at 9:55 AM Hunter Beast <hunter@surmount•systems> wrote:\n>\n> I'm surprised nobody's noticed this. It's an interesting approach. I wouldn't discount it because it relies on incentives, since bitcoin mining itself is secure only through cryptoeconomic incentives, and yet that's good enough. Plenty of things on bitcoin aren't perfect, but they're good enough to do the job.\n>\n> Some questions...\n> - What are some of the advantages of using slashing covenants instead of BitVM?
