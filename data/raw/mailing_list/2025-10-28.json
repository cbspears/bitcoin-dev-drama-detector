If we cap\nthe OP_RETURN outputs to 80 bytes and 1 per transaction, the folks using\nthese protocols will simply have no choice but to instead place their data\nfor publication into bare multisig outputs.  This outcome would be\nobjectively worse for everyone involved.  The protocol users will have to\npay someone higher fees.  Everyone's UTXO sets will be bloated with these\nunspendable transactions, and, unlike with OP_RETURN, there will be no way\nto decide which bare multisigs are being used as a poor man's\nbulletin board, and which ones are legitimate.\n\nIn fact, any attempt to cap OP_RETURN outputs will force those users to use\nbare multisigs instead, or perhaps use non OP_RETURN methods, such as OP_O\nOP_VERIFY, or whatever, which would be just worse for everyone involved.\n\nBitcoin Core 30 is *fixing* an existing problem, and trying to roll things\nback would unsolve the problem.  In fact, such a softfork would make the\nproblem much worse by transforming a block reconstruction problem into a\ndeliberate push towards having user who need to publish data into using\nuncensorable bare multisig outputs instead.\n\nOn Tue, Oct 28, 2025 at 12:09 PM Majorian <majorianbtc@gmail•com> wrote:\n\n> Dear Bitcoin Development Mailing List,\n>\n> I hope this email finds you well.

          "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'd like to give an update on my Consensus Cleanup work, now BIP54.\n\nI opened an implementation against Bitcoin Inquisition v29.1 at [0]. It contains extensive testing\nof each of the four proposed mitigations, and was used as a basis to generate test vectors for\nBIP54. I opened a PR against the BIPs repository to add them to BIP54 [1].\n\nThe test vectors for the transaction-level sigops limit contain a wide variety of usage combinations\nas well as ways of running into the limit. They also include some historical violations as well as\npathological transactions demonstrating the implementation details of the sigop accounting logic\n(which was itself borrowed from that of BIP16, which all Bitcoin implementations presumably already\nhave).\n\nThe test vectors for the new witness-stripped transaction size restriction similarly exercise the\nbounds of the check under various conditions (e.g. transactions with/without a witness). All\nhistorical violations were also added to the test vectors, thanks to Chris Stewart for digging those\nup.\n\nBecause the new timestamp restrictions are tailor-made to the mainnet difficulty adjustment\nparameters, the test vectors for those contain a number of chains of mainnet headers (from genesis).\nEach test case contains a full header chain and whether it is valid according to BIP54. These chains\nwere generated using a custom miner available in [2] and added to the implementation as a JSON data\nfile.\n\nThe test vectors for the coinbase restriction similarly include a chain of mainnet blocks, because\nthe timelock check is context-dependent. These were generated using a similar miner also available\nat [2].\n\nI'm seeking feedback on these test vectors from everybody but in particular developers of\nalternative Bitcoin clients, as compatibility with other Bitcoin implementations than Bitcoin Core\nwas a design goal.\n\nBest,\nAntoine Poinsot\n\n[0]: https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/99\n[1]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/201",

          "body": "Hi Riard,\n\nThanks for the feedback. I understand your point as asking about other costs besides quadratic\nhashing, and how the BIP54 \"potentially executed\" sigop limit relates to those.\n\nThere are indeed several other expensive operations when validating a block: ECDSA signature\nverifications, FindAndDelete's vector modifications, and prevout lookups. This last one is related\nto the recently discussed limit on scriptPubKey sizes [0], as they present a constant factor\nincrease in the lookup cost that is not bounded by the size of the block being validated.\n\nIn any case the cost of these other expensive operations is completely dwarfed by quadratic hashing. The\nexample you give is unfortunately far from the worst case. I added you to the semi-private Delving\nthread [1] which contains the detail of the calculations for various DoS blocks. Feel free also to\nreach out to me in private, if you prefer email to Delving.\n\nFurthermore, exploiting the prevout lookup cost is highly uneconomical to a miner. It requires over\na hundred preparation blocks in order to create a single block that would take a couple dozens of\nseconds to validate on a modern machine. By comparison, without the BIP54 sigops limit this same\neffect can be achieved with 2 orders of magnitude less preparation blocks, making the attack viable\nfor a revenue-maximizing miner. Without the BIP54 sigops limit, over a hundred preparation blocks\nalso gets you a block that takes over 10 minutes to validate on a modern machine.\n\nFinally, besides having diminishing returns these mitigations would also have a higher confiscatory\nsurface [2]. The BIP54 mitigation was chosen because it pinpoints exactly the harmful behaviour we\nwant to prevent, with only a minimal impact on potentially legitimate usage [3], while making\nattacks of miners on their competition uneconomical as well as making the very worst case largely\nuninteresting to an externally-motivated attacker.\n\nBest,\nAntoine\n\n[0]: https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/O",

          "body": "[-- Attachment #1: Type: text/plain, Size: 11189 bytes --]\n\n> bare multisigs can easily violate the proposed limit\n\nGood point. I can imagine a Script, which could allow something like\n1-of-460 multisig: if all public keys would be hashed, then it would take\n21 bytes to push any given hash. And then, pushing 460 hashes would take\n460*21=9660 bytes. Then, to clean it up, OP_2DROP would consume two\nelements, so that means 230 bytes, to clean it up with OP_2DROPs, and a\nsingle OP_DROP.\n\nI think it could be something like that:\n\nOP_TOALTSTACK <9660 bytes> OP_FROMALTSTACK OP_PICK OP_TOALTSTACK\n<OP_2DROP*229> OP_DROP\nOP_DUP OP_HASH160 OP_FROMALTSTACK OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\n\nAnd then, this is how it could be executed:\n\n<sig> <pubkey> <number>                    //input stack\n<sig> <pubkey>                             //toaltstack\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes>            //pushing hashes\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes> <number>   //pushing number\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes> <hash>     //picking hash\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes>            //toaltstack\n<sig> <pubkey>                             //dropping the rest\n<sig> <pubkey> <pubkey>                    //dup\n<sig> <pubkey> <hash>                      //hash160\n<sig> <pubkey> <hash> <hash>               //fromaltstack\n<sig> <pubkey>                             //equalverify\nOP_TRUE                                    //checksig\n\nWhich means, that it would take 9660 bytes, plus 230 bytes of dropping, so\nit sums up to 9890 bytes. Then, 9 bytes are consumed by the rest of the\nenvelope, and that leaves 101 bytes for signature and public key. Seems\ndoable. But I didn't check it in regtest yet.\n\npon., 20 paź 2025 o 18:48 Greg Maxwell <gmaxwell@gmail•com> napisał(a):\n\n> Perhaps it's also worth explicitly pointing out for people following at\n> home how this proposal has a very real confiscation risk:  bare\n> multisigs can easily violate the proposed limit-- if uncompressed points\n> are used an \"of 8\" policy is suffici",

Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n\nCompatibility\n==============\n\nBitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the\nLinux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+. Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\n\nNotable changes\n===============\n\nPolicy\n------\n\n- The maximum number of potentially executed legacy signature operations in \na\n  single standard transaction is now limited to 2500.

My approach has been to stick with\nScript: even if you prefer other approaches, you should find this\nrestoration and enhancement of script capabilities a useful comparison.\n\nCurrent drafts in \"review me!\" format:\n\n\thttps://github.com/rustyrussell/bips/pull/1\n\nHere is a brief description of each:\n\n1. Varops Budget For Script Runtime Constraint (bip-unknown-varops-budget.mediawiki)\n\nThis extends and generalizes the sigops budget into a \"variable\noperations\" budget, using benchmarks taken from the prototype\nimplementation across various machines.  This budget is per transaction,\nby weight, designed to constrain usage to ensure rapid evaluation\nwithout overly restricting scripting ability.\n\n2. Restoration of Script Capabilities\n\nOnce the safety net of the varops budget is in place, disabled opcodes\ncan be re-enabled, stack object size and total capacity extended, and\nabitrary-length arithmetic restored (though numbers are now always\nunsigned).\n\n3. OP_TX\n\nOnce script can handle large data once more, the problem of\nintrospection is signficantly simplified: we can simply have an opcode\nwhich pushes parts of the current transaction onto the stack.  The\nconcrete design proposed here is a fruitful area for debate and review.\n\n4. New Opcodes for Tapscript v2\n\nThe most speculative part of the series suggests some opcodes which\nwould allow more optimal use of Script: OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK,\nOP_SEGMENT, OP_BYTEREV, OP_ECPOINTADD, OP_INTERNALKEY and OP_MULTI.\nSome of these are old friends, and others may be new to you: I look\nforward to your feedback.\n\nThere is also a prototype implementation we used for testing:\n\n\thttps://github.com/jmoik/bitcoin/tree/gsr\n\nThankyou in advance for your consideration!\nRusty & Julian.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Develop",

Note that expressing \"negative\" values are probably desirable,\nparticularly -G; eg the BIP340 signature equation becomes:\n\n   s*(-G) + 1*R + H(..)*P = 0\n\nin that model. The Taproot address check is:\n\n   (+/-)1*T = 1*IPK + H(..)*G = 0\n\nwhere the sign for T is taken from the control block.\n\nFWIW, bll does this with the `secp256k1_muladd` opcode, and example code\nfor verifying a taproot script against a scriptPubKey is at\nhttps://github.com/ajtowns/bllsh/blob/master/examples/test-taproot\n\nCheers,\naj\n\n-- \nYou ",

It could be implemented as a hard fork OR as a consensus that quantum actors can legitimately move funds to safe addresses for protective custody and public good. It could even go forward with no consensuses at all since it is functionally equivalent to a quantum winner-takes-all at the protocol level.\n\nBIP: TBD\nTitle: Quantum Secure Asset Verification & Escrow (QSAVE)\nAuthor: James Tagg\nStatus: Draft\nType: Standards Track\nLayer: Consensus (Consensus / Soft Fork / Hard Fork)\nCreated:\nLicense:\n\nAbstract\n\nThis BIP proposes QSAVE (Quantum Secure Asset Verification & Escrow) - a non-sovereign wealth fund providing protective custody for Bitcoin vulnerable to quantum attack (see Appendix for detailed vulnerability assessment). QSAVE preserves 100% of the principal for rightful owners while using generated returns to fund the protocol and global public good. It provides an alternative to the QRAMP (Quantum Resistant Asset Migration Protocol) proposal (which makes coins unspendable) or taking no action (which allows quantum appropriation, which many view as theft). This proposal addresses coins that are dormant but acknowledges there may be coins that have quantum watermarks but have not migrated to quantum addresses. A separate BIP proposal will address this case.\n\nMotivation\n\nChain analysis reveals 3.5-5.5 million Bitcoin (~17-28% of circulating supply) have exposed public keys vulnerable to quantum attack (see Appendix: Quantum Vulnerability Assessment for detailed breakdown).\n\nWith sufficient education and proactive migration, a significant portion of the 2-4M BTC in reused addresses could be moved to quantum-safe addresses before the threat materializes. Modern wallets are increasingly implementing best practices such as always sending change to fresh addresses. However,",

It turns quantum security into a private incentive: fail to\nupgrade and you will certainly lose access to your funds, creating a\ncertainty where none previously existed.\n\n   -\n\n   Phase A: Disallows sending of any funds to quantum-vulnerable addresses,\n   hastening the adoption of P2QRH address types.\n   -\n\n   Phase B: Renders ECDSA/Schnorr spends invalid, preventing all spending\n   of funds in quantum-vulnerable UTXOs. This is triggered by a\n   well-publicized flag-day roughly five years after activation.\n   -\n\n   Phase C (optional): Pending further research and demand, a separate BIP\n   proposing a fork to allow recovery of legacy UTXOs through ZK proof of\n   possession of BIP-39 seed phrase.\n\nMotivation\n\nWe seek to secure the value of the UTXO set and minimize incentives for\nquantum attacks. This proposal is radically different from any in Bitcoin’s\nhistory just as the threat posed by quantum computing is radically\ndifferent from any other threat in Bitcoin’s history.  Never before has\nBitcoin faced an existential threat to its cryptographic primitives. A\nsuccessful quantum attack on Bitcoin would result in significant economic\ndisruption and dama",

It would disincentivize normal mining because miners could make more money by cracking these PoW-locked coins than they could by actually securing the network (by finding blocks).

Together, they address the absence \nof an interoperable, canonical, secure format for wallet backups and \ntransfers.\n\n*1. Standard Encrypted Wallet Payload*\nA CBOR based format for serialising wallet data — including \ndescriptor-based accounts, optional transactions/UTXOs, metadata, and root \nsecrets. It cleanly separates the core data structure from its \ncryptographic protection, with encryption mandated via a companion \nstandard. This builds on BIPs 329, 380, 388, and 389, emphasising \nextensibility and deterministic encoding to enable reliable restores across \nwallets.\nThe draft BIP can be found here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/KeysSoze/7109a7f0455897b1930f851bde6337e3\n\n\n*2. Standard Wallet Encryption Envelope*\nA secure, versioned container for encrypting the payload using a password \nderived key with Argon2id, with scope for future extensions such as \nasymmetric encryption. It aims to provide robust protection while keeping \nthe format modular and library-agnostic.\nThe draft BIP can be found here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/KeysSoze/866d009ccd082edf6802df240154b20d\n\n\nBoth drafts are at a very early stage. I’m seeking feedback on the overall \napproach, technical details, potential gaps, and ways to improve them \nbefore formalising further or submitting PRs to the BIPs repository.\n\nThanks in advance for your review and input.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/06b5d067-7293-4618-b3c5-510380a55efan%40googlegroups.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #1.2: Type: text/html, Size: 2208 bytes --]",

This allows wallets to derive codex32 \nbackups from BIP-0032 master keys.\n\n*Summary* \n\n   - \n   \n   Application number: 93'\n   - Derivation path: \n   m/83696968'/93'/{hrp}'/{threshold}'/{n}'/{byte_length}'/{id0}'/{id1}'/{id2}'/{id3}'/{index}' \n   \nCodex32, defined in BIP-93, is a human-readable encoding with checksumming \nand share indexing designed for SSS backups of BIP-0032 seeds. This PR \nproposes a deterministic way to generate codex32 strings using BIP-85.\n\n*Rationale* \n\n   - \n   \n   Mirrors the existing BIP-85 application for BIP-39.\n   - \n   \n   Codex32 offers error correction, hand verification, identifiers, and \n   secret sharing features compared to BIP-39.\n   - \n   \n   Adds a standardized way for wallets to generate codex32 backups from \n   BIP-85-derived entropy\n   - \n   \n   Test vectors and reference implementation are linked to in the PR.\n   \n*Risks and alternatives* \n\n   - \n   \n   Wallet adoption of codex32 is still limited, though a draft PR #32652 \n   <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32652?utm_source=chatgpt.com> \n   for importing codex32 strings to Bitcoin Core has support.\n   - Codex32 implementers could use the BIP-85 dice application, but \n   defining a direct application improves interoperability.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/compare/master...BenWestgate:bips:codex32 \n<https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/compare/master...BenWestgate:bips:codex32?utm_source=chatgpt.com>\n\nFeedback is welcome.\nBest regards,\nBen Westgate\n\n-- \nYou received this message bec",

It's intended as an enum, although I don't see \"cl\" in \nBIP-93, the same way I see \"ms\"?\n\nIs there anything we can do to simplify or clarify the derivation paths? \nThey are not \"wrong\" per se but these will be the longest derivation paths \nin the BIP-85 spec and I'm wondering if there's room for \"less is more\" in \nthe derivation path.\n\n> Pseudocode: character_value = int.from_bytes(drng.read(1), \"big\") >> 3\n\nThis is sensible with respect to deriving a single bech32 character but \nhere and in the description above the number of characters we are drawing \ncould be clarified consistent with the \"Bytes Length Table\" and there also \nit should be clarified if this is bytes drawn or bytes retained or \nsomething else. It could further be clarified that all draws are from the \nsame DRNG instance. For example, elsewhere in BIP-85 we pass the .read \n*method* (not an invocation) since in RSA key gen the number of draws is \nunknown ahead of time. In your case the number of draws is known but again \nthe pseudocode should clarify how many draws or iterations to obtain a \ncomplete share or secret as a function of the derivation path segments.\n\nDrawing and truncating a single byte per character is certainly clear to \nunderstand but I keep wondering if implementers shouldn't draw ((chars * 5) \n// 8) bytes in one shot? These bytes aren't expensive or anything but it's \nless iterations, less total reads, etc. If my suggestion becomes hard to \nread or write then feel free to keep as is.\n\nOn Thursday, September 4, 2025 at 9:50:57 AM UTC-7 Ben Westgate wrote:\n\n> Thanks Javier for confirming my updates address your concerns,\n> Andrew Poelstra and Russell O'Connor gave feedback on the bip85 codex32 \n> application, they:\n> - support it for recoverable \"uncle-Jim\"-style child codex32 strings for \n> forgetful relatives.\n> - prefer wallets gener",

But to date integration\nwith Bitcoin has been scant.\n\nTo resolve that issue, Blockchain Commons has been working on demos that\nintegrate the ZF FROST library with BDK, to demonstrate how to sign Bitcoin\nPSBTs with FROST, including support for the Taproot tweak.\n\nHere's the two demos that we recently produced:\n\n* TRUSTED DEALER:\n    * Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8csdApREJIs\n    * Code Walkthrough: https://hackmd.io/y6EYPYR0SluE0M0az7Y3uw\n    * Notes: https://hackmd.io/@bc-community/H1MfEMdvel\n\n* DISTRIBUTED KEY GENERATION:\n    * Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13skzOvWklk\n    * Code Walkthrough: https://hackmd.io/cI9OVAbzSDemrcvsf9t0ag\n\nOur goal this year is a \"Learning FROST from the Command Line\" to\nsupplement our popular \"Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line\" tutorial:\nhttps://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line\n\nThe first demo was held in conjunction with our newest FROST meeting. It\nwas our fifth to date. At each, we've gathered together implementers and\ndevelopers, to help make FROST usage into a reality.\n\nOur full list of major FROST meetings is here:\nhttps://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/#events\n\nWe'll be holding one or two more this fall! If you've got a FROST-related\nproject or FROST-related code you'd like to demo, let me know and I'm\nthrilled to get you on board for a presentation!\n\nMany thanks to Human Rights Foundation and our other sustaining sponsors\nsuch as Foundation Devices, Unchained Capital; and individual monthly\nsponsors like Jesse Posner, Brian Bishop, Jameson Lopp, Glenn Willen for\nsupporting this work.\n\nIf you are interested in supporting us use\nhttps://",

Alongside introspection enabling op\ncodes, this enables the creation of a new flavor of on-chain state machine\nwithin Bitcoin Script. The set of op codes is also generic enough to enable\nseveral other use cases related to (optimized DLCs, partial musig2 signature\nverification, EC based sigma protocols, etc).\n\nA total of 4 op codes are proposed (each allocated from the existing\nOP_SUCCESS) range:\n  * `OP_EC_POINT_ADD`\n  * `OP_EC_POINT_MUL`\n  * `OP_EC_POINT_NEGATE`\n  * `OP_EC_POINT_X_COORD`\n\nThe full BIP text can be found here:\n * https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1945\n\nA reference implementation in `btcd` can be found here:\n  * https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/pull/2413\n\n--Laolu\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/CAO3Pvs-Cwj%3D5vJgBfDqZGtvmoYPMrpKYFAYHRb_EqJ5i0PG0cA%40mail.gmail.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #2: Type: text/html, Size: 1887 bytes --]",
