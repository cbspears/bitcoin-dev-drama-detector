These schemes exhibit significant storage overheads, hindering \ntheir practical application. This paper introduces ESSPI, an optimized \nmethod leveraging ECDSA/Schnorr signatures to sign the BitVMX program \ninput. With Schnorr signatures we achieve an optimal 1:1 data expansion, \ncompared to the current known best ratio of 1:200 based on Winternitz \nsignatures. To accomplish this we introduce 4 innovations to BitVMX: (1) a \nmodification of the BitVMX CPU, adding a challengeable hashing core to it, \n(2) a new partition-based search to detect fraud during hashing, (3) a new \nenhanced transaction DAG with added data-carrying transactions with a \nfraud-verifying smart-contract and (4) a novel timelock-based method for \nproving data availability to Bitcoin smart contracts. The enhanced BitVMX \nprotocol enables the verification of uncompressed inputs such as SPV \nproofs, NiPoPoWs, or longer computation integrity proofs, such as STARKs.\n\nBest, Sergio.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/3e49d257-7d44-4c19-a157-eb479ca0a4b9n%40googlegroups.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #1.2: Type: text/html, Size: 2146 bytes --]",

If and when (and that's a big if) the existence of a cryptography-breaking QC becomes a credible threat, the Bitcoin ecosystem has no other option than softforking(*) out the ability to spend from signature schemes (including ECDSA and BIP340) that are vulnerable to QCs.

If PQC signatures aren't added, such as with BIP-360, there will be some concern around long exposure attacks on P2TR coins.\n\nThere were literally millions of BTC locked in outputs whose public keys are already known to the public, long before P2TR. Either because of they're in P2PK outputs, because they're in hashed addresses which have been reused and already using for spending, or because they're been spent in forked chains. There are likely substantially more BTC in outputs whose public keys are known to multiple parties (multisig, lightning channels, escrow services, ...) but not to the entire world.\n\nI certainly agree there is no urgency right now, but if (and only if) cryptography-breaking QCs become a reality, the ecosystem has no choice but disabling(*) the spending of coins through schemes that become broken, and n",

The proposed improvements are motivated\nfor diverse reasons detailed subsequently. Currently, there has been 2 draft\nBIPs proposed [0] [1]. A modular overhaul of the transaction-relay protocol\nwas already discussed few years ago [2].\n\n## Problems\n\nAs a reminder, the Bitcoin transaction-relay protocol in its simple flow \n(i.e\nno package and no erlay) for inter-node single transaction communication \nworks\nin the following rough way:\n- a wallet do an initial broadcast of a new tx to a node A\n- node A do an INV(MSG_TX, TXID) message to node B\n- node B replies with GETDATA(MSG_TX, TXID)\n- node A forwards the new transaction with a TX message\n\nAs far as I know, the transaction-relay protocol as work in the following\nway since the very first releases of the original bitcoin software. There is\nindeed a myriad of other subtleties that have been added in the time, for \ngood\nreasons, here go to see a full-node codebase.\n\nThis approach comes up with a number of practical problems.\n\n## 1. Transaction-Relay as Denial-of-Service Vector\n\nThere could be scenarios where puppets peers are deliberately sending junk\ntransactions traffic that is burdening a target node CPU time [3] [4]. In my\nunderstanding, this is not necessarily one of the most concerning DoS risk\naffecting Bitcoin full-nodes partaking in in the transaction-relay network,\nhowever this can be still concerning.\n\n## 2. Transaction-Propagation Deanonymization Vector\n\nSome gap in the current transaction-relay protocol allows mass-connectors\nto broadcast transactions without first sending an INV message. Indeed, \ncurrent\nbitcoin core software accepts a raw TX message, even if has not been paired \nby\nan INV or asked for by a GETDATA. Exploiting this behavior, mass-connectors\ncan bypass tx-relay timers to gather more information on the \ntransaction",

He can propose a \ntype 5, but you'll probably reject that because >80 bytes will be \nnon-standard for other users.  You can create an extension numeric \nrange, but then you'll have to centrally coordinate number assignment \nfor every random proposal.  Instead, I think it makes more sense to not \nuse versioning at all and just perform local verification on raw() \ndescriptors; that way users of your software can modify one line of code \non their side to accept >80 bytes and everyone else can use the default \ntests.\n\nIn addition to the above technical criticism, I find the BOSD name \nextremely conflationary with the longstanding use of \"output script \ndescripto",

I'm consistently seeing unconfirmed transactions from months ago being rebroadcast and (now that the mempool is draining) eventually confirming, without anyone even trying to exploit anything. So from what I can tell, the only thing this really accomplishes is wasting CPU cycles and bandwidth evicting and later re-accepting the transactions in question.\n\nAll it would take is one person running a rebroadcasting service to make\nmempool eviction useless except in the rare case that a soft-fork of\nstandard transactions has happened.

The prior times that I \ninvestigated this claim, transactions with feerates lower than \n`minTxRelayFee` exclusively appeared at the front of the block, \nindicating that they were explicitly prioritized by the miner, probably \ndue to out-of-band payment. You may now also find some TRUC transactions \nwhere a low-feerate parent is carried by a higher feerate child. Neither \nof these two indicates that a miner has configured a lower `-blockmintxfee`.\nYou could convince me that a miner has configured a lower \n`-blockmintxfee` by showing us a block that includes transactions with \nfeerates below `minTxRelayFee` appearing in the organic descending \nfeerate order.\n\nOn 2025-01-31 08:43, Greg Tonoski wrote:\n > I can't see how minrelaytxfee=0.00000001 could increase risk of DoS\n > attack or make it significantly cheaper or more effective.

OP_TX and OP_TXHASH/VERIFY are examples\nhow developers sought to overcome certain pain points. However they expand\nthe scope considerably and also rely on 64 bit integer arithmetic to handle\namounts. Here we aim to show and alternative approach that covers a lot of\nuseful ground in the in-between without state-carrying covenants or general\ndetailed introspection.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/moonsettler/d2369e043473c42ff7fa52878dd064a5\n\n## CTV++\n\nTwo additional opcodes to consider as an addition to `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY`:\n\n* OP_TEMPLATEHASH\n* OP_INPUTAMOUNTS\n\nTogether they relax the strict limitations that `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY`\nimposes, because it explicitly commits to the output amounts and therefore\nimplicitly commits to the spendable input amounts in a lot of cases.\n\n### OP_TEMPLATEHASH\n\nBuilds the CTV template hash from the stack.\n\n```\n<inputIndex>\n# FOR i = inputCount-1; i >= 0; i--; LOOP\n  <sequence[i]>\n# END LOOP\n<inputCount>\n<nLockTime>\n# FOR j = outputCount-1; j >= 0; j--; LOOP\n  <out[j].amount>\n  <out[j].script>\n# END LOOP\n<outputCount>\n<nVersion>\nOP_TEMPLATEHASH\nOP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY\n```\n\n### OP_INPUTAMOUNTS\nTaproot only. Consumes a 32 bit signed integer `n` as parameter\n* `n = 0` return the SUM of all input amounts with same script\n* `n < 0` return the SUM of last abs(n) input amounts including current input\n* `n > 0` return the SUM of first n input amounts of the transaction\n\nfails if\n* `n < 0` and `abs(n) > inputIndex + 1`\n* `n > inputCount`\n\n```\n<n>\nOP_INPUTAMOUNTS\n```\n\n#### Example use:\n\nThis contract below allows the comining of UTXOs locked by the same script for\nsomething like a withdrawal from a Vault contract to a staging address where\nthe relative time lock can begin.

Tweak it, or use a new random \nkey. This is a non-issue\n\nThis is an issue at present. I hope you fix it as you seem to be \n[involved][1] in cashu development. The workarounds that you suggested will \nstill allow a **specific** key to be censored.\n\n>  As for authentication systems, yes of course KYC-backed authentication \nwould allow censorship, but that is an optional spec which mints aren't \ncompelled to implement or use, even once the spec is finished. AFAIK no \nmint implementations have this system in code yet, so it's not even a \nfeature at this point: just a proposed NUT document, sitting in draft \nstatus. Your assertion that \"none of the ecash implementation are \ncensorship resistant\" is a blatantly false statement bereft of fact or \ndepth.\n\nBeing optional does not matter. It is **possible** for a mint to use \nauthentication which is the whole point of this mailing list post. It is \ntrue that none of the ecash implementations are censorship resistant. Just \nbecause censorship isn't implemented yet by mints does not mean the \nprotocol is censorship resistant.\n\nThe false statements exist in cashu docs with misleading things about \ncensorship resistance.\n\n>  At worst they might lose the money they already stored with the \ncompromised mint, which is always a risk to keep in mind with ecash.\n\nThis is already described in my post.\n\n>  So ecash devs have proposed standardized auth systems which would give \nmint runners the *option* of knuckling under to KYC. I agree it would suck \nto be put to that choice, but giving them the freedom to choose is \nimportant and valid, and in no way compromises the integrity of other \nnon-KYC mints who perhaps operate freely in more enlightened jurisdictions. \n\nStandardizing KYC in the protocol is the opposite of freedom and privacy. \nJurisdict",

With the\nrapid advancement in quantum computing, this proposal outlines the\nintegration of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (SPHINCS+ and\nDilithium) to safeguard Bitcoin’s long-term security.\n\nThe key points of the proposal are:\n- Introduction of quantum-resistant signature algorithms (SPHINCS+ and\nDilithium).\n- New Bech32-based address formats for quantum-resistant addresses.\n- Modifications to transaction structures and script opcodes to support\nlarger signature sizes.\n- A transition mechanism through a soft fork to ensure backward\ncompatibility with existing Bitcoin addresses and transactions.\n\nThe full BIP draft is available here\nhttps://github.com/chucrut/bips/blob/master/bip-xxxx.md for your review and\nfeedback.

There was a \nsimilar concern over RSA about 25 years ago, and the question of the \nexponent related to the operation as a matter of security. They weren't \nsure if the exponent should be high, random or irrelevant to the security. \nTurns out that it was irrelevant, so the cryptography community relaxed and \nselected the exponent 3 for RSA for performance reasons with no cost to \nsecurity. When a parameter is so relevant to the security of FALCON it is \nalarming, and the algorithm may be unsuitable for blockchain. \n\nI would suggest NTRU Prime by Daniel Bernstein as a solid contender for \nsecure Lattice. Critically to a heterogenous environment, it is not \nsusceptible to side channel attacks so the keys cannot be stolen through \nmagnets next to a thumb drive. Daniel Bernstein managed to perform side \nchannel attacks 10 out of 10 times on multiple NIST PQ standards.\n\nA quantum network runs 45x faster than the same qubits assigned to a single \nmachine. https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15465\nQuantum networks also require less wiring, and a 6000 node network of 1152 \nqubit machines can crack bitcoin in 10 minutes on \naverage. https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08585 The qubit count is expected to go \ndown by at least 30% by 2027 due to general improvement in the algorithm. \nLitinski explained his algorithm at Crypto conference, and included further \noptimizations to lower the qubit count and increase \nperformance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AumHpDRS5iI\n\nThe scaling of some machines and algorithms is indeed \nlinear https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02892 but this is not always true.

Checking all tx sizes is far more overhead than \nvalidating the coinbase for a null point. As AntoineP agreed, it cannot be \ndone earlier, and I have shown that it is *significantly* more \ncomputationally intensive. It makes the determination much more costly and \nin all other cases by adding an additional check that serves no purpose.\n\nI think for any (new) consensus rule, we shall be able to evalute its \nimplication in term of at least 2 dimensions a) memory overhead (e.g do a \nfull-node needs more memory to validate post-segwit blocks now that witness \nfields are discounted ?) and b) computational overhead (e.g do a full-node \nneeds more CPU cycles to validate confidential transactions perdersen \ncommitments ?). A same consensus rule can achieve the same effect e.g \nreducing headers merkle tree ambiguities, with completely different memory \nor computational cost. For the checking all tx sizes vs validating the \ncoinbase for a null point, indeed I agree with you that the latter is \nintuitively better on the 2 dimensions.\n\n> I think you misunderstood me. Of course the witness commitment must be \nvalidated (as I said, \"Yet it remains necessary to validate the witness \ncommitment...\"), as otherwise the witnesses within a block can be anything \nwithout affecting the block hash. And of course the witness commitment is \ncomputed in the same manner as the tx commitment and is therefore subject \nto the same malleations. However, because the coinbase tx is committed to \nthe block hash, there is no need to guard the witness commitment for \nmalleation. And to my knowled",

While creating these covenants is as easy as\ncreating a transaction with P2WSH output, spending these covenants\nrequires substantial computation and involves creating very large\nbitcoin transactions.\n\nSpending such a covenant requires ~2^86 hash calls to SHA-1 and\nRIPEMD-160.  In comparison, mining a Bitcoin block at current\ndifficulty requires ~2^78.3 hash calls to SHA256x2. Thus, spending\nsuch a covenant would require the same number of hash queries the\nentire Bitcoin network does in roughly ~33 hours. Such covenants could\nbe created today, but spending them likely requires the creation of\ndedicated ASICs.\n\nWhile the computational costs limit the immediate applicability of our\ncovenants, we are optimistic that future work can significantly\nimprove these numbers. This approach is not a replacement for a\ncovenant opcode because:\n1. High computational cost: Our approach is likely to be many orders\nof magnitude more computationally expensive than a covenant opcode.\n2. 4Mb transactions: Transaction size, computation cost trade-off\nexists that reduces the computational costs of these covenants by\nincreasing the transaction size. Due to most of the cost being\ncomputational it is likely they always be just under 4MB in size even\nwith efficiency gain. 4MB is the limit for valid transactions.\n\nOur approach is framed around covenants, but our approach enables\narbitrary computation on Bitcoin transaction data. This arbitrary\ncomputation is bounded only by the circuit size we can pack into what\nis left of a 4Mb Bitcoin transaction after it contains all our\nnecessary machinery. This means, for example, we can do Tapscript\nlamport signatures that sign the sighash of the spending transaction.\n\nOne of the auth",

The advantage of this approach\nis that it is efficient, does not add new cryptographic assumptions\nand is possible on Bitcoin today.\n\nThis protocol uses very similar mechanisms to BitVM, originally I\nthought this was how BitVM worked, which is why I didn’t publish it.\nAfter talking to many people it appears this technique is not used in\nBitVM.\n\n\nNotation\n====\nBy <x>32 we denote a value, x, in Bitcoin Script which is encoded as a\nlist of 32-bit stack elements. We can perform arbitrary computation on\nsuch values using Bitcoin’s math opcodes, a.k.a., Small Script.\n\nProtocol\n====\nThe essential problem for enforcing covenants in Bitcoin outputs is\nshowing that a signature s1 that will pass CHECKSIGVERIFY is equal to\na signature s2 encoded for Small Script. This is because once we get a\nsignature into Small Script, we extract the sighash and do transaction\nintrospection. ColliderScript gets us covenants by using hash\ncollisions to check equality between s1 and <s2>32. CAT gets us\ncovenants by simply concatenating all the <s2>32 and then comparing\nagainst s1 using EQUAL:\n\ns2 = CAT(<s2>32 [0], <s2>32 [1],  <s2>32 [2], … <s2>32 [15])\nEQUAL s1, s2\n\nSlashing covenants works by removing the requirement for this equality\ncheck, but instead providing a fraud proof ifs1!=s2, and posting that\nfraud proof to punish the spending party. To do this we construct a\nBitcoin script output which takes as input:\n\ns1 - t",
