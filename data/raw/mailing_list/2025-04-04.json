Only the smallest of nodes operate in\nblocks only mode afaik. With a scheme like this, the delta would expand\nsignificantly, potentially weakening the transaction relay network.\n\nSuch a disjunction between the cost of transaction verification during\nrelay vs. during block validation also represents a further externality\nimposed on node runners which is not compensated (as node runners do not\ngain fees for verifying and relaying transactions, and their primary\nbenefit comes in the form of finality by verifying blocks).\n\nAll the best,\n\n-- \n--Brandon\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/Z_AoU94vMDskLJ4Z%40console.",

So sticking to v29 back-ports isn't a long term viable option.\n\n\nI think it's worth considering for the lightning industry to organize a custom signet, either a 1-of-N with keys distributed among the current players, or unsigned proof-of-work based (more hassle, but future new players may feel more comfortable joining). Such a network can be kept online definitely and its replacement can be more easily coordinated. Another advantage is that soft fork proposals can be tested, similar to how Inquisition does that on the default signet, but at a pace that matches Bolt spec work.\n\n- Sjors\n\n> Op 31 mrt 2025, om 23:15 heeft Sanket Kanjalkar <sanket1729@gmail•com> het volgende geschreven:\n> \n> Hi Sjors, \n> Thanks for asking.

Additionally, real-time monitoring of vulnerable addresses \nwould help mitigate risks.\n\nAnother key point is to avoid panic. Instead of a sudden \"D-Day\" where \neverything changes at once, the deactivation of old UTXOs should be \ngradual, with clear communication so no one feels forced or disadvantaged.\n\nIn summary, this is not about imposing rules or confiscating anything, but \nabout providing options for an orderly transition that doesn’t compromise \nBitcoin’s philosophy.\n\n-Javier Mateos\n\nEl viernes, 28 de marzo de 2025 a las 21:02:43 UTC-3, Matt Corallo escribió:\n\n>\n>\n> On 3/25/25 4:16 AM, Sjors Provoost wrote:\n> > Matt Corallo wrote:\n> > \n> >>> In that scenario you'd need to use a NUMS point for the key path.

Consolidation of inputs\nis often bad for privacy and makes silent payments, coinjoin etc. useless\nin some cases however the user has the choice to select coins manually\nwhile transacting.

          "body": "Slashing covenants is a protocol for covenants in Bitcoin via\nincentives. A covenant is a set of rules about what transactions can\nspend a Bitcoin output which is encumbered by that covenant. Typically\na covenant is enforced by preventing someone from spending that\noutput. In this protocol we instead allow the spending of the output\nand then punish the spender by a loss of funds, i.e. we slash them, if\nthey do not follow the rules of the covenant. This is less secure than\na covenant enforced by an opcode, FE or ColliderScript, because it\nrelies on incentives over enforcement. The advantage of this approach\nis that it is efficient, does not add new cryptographic assumptions\nand is possible on Bitcoin today.\n\nThis protocol uses very similar mechanisms to BitVM, originally I\nthought this was how BitVM worked, which is why I didn’t publish it.\nAfter talking to many people it appears this technique is not used in\nBitVM.\n\n\nNotation\n====\nBy <x>32 we denote a value, x, in Bitcoin Script which is encoded as a\nlist of 32-bit stack elements. We can perform arbitrary computation on\nsuch values using Bitcoin’s math opcodes, a.k.a., Small Script.\n\nProtocol\n====\nThe essential problem for enforcing covenants in Bitcoin outputs is\nshowing that a signature s1 that will pass CHECKSIGVERIFY is equal to\na signature s2 encoded for Small Script. This is because once we get a\nsignature into Small Script, we extract the sighash and do transaction\nintrospection. ColliderScript gets us covenants by using hash\ncollisions to check equality between s1 and <s2>32. CAT gets us\ncovenants by simply concatenating all the <s2>32 and then comparing\nagainst s1 using EQUAL:\n\ns2 = CAT(<s2>32 [0], <s2>32 [1],  <s2>32 [2], … <s2>32 [15])\nEQUAL s1, s2\n\nSlashing covenants works by removing the requirement for this equality\ncheck, but instead providing a fraud proof ifs1!=s2, and posting that\nfraud proof to punish the spending party. To do this we construct a\nBitcoin script output which takes as input:\n\ns1 - t",

Most likely we'll get\nsome tag-length-value encoding scheme.\n\nApplications already using annexes who want to also take advantage of\nnew consensus features will of course have to upgrade their encoding\nschemes to match.

If and when (and that's a big if) the existence of a cryptography-breaking QC becomes a credible threat, the Bitcoin ecosystem has no other option than softforking(*) out the ability to spend from signature schemes (including ECDSA and BIP340) that are vulnerable to QCs.

If PQC signatures aren't added, such as with BIP-360, there will be some concern around long exposure attacks on P2TR coins.\n\nThere were literally millions of BTC locked in outputs whose public keys are already known to the public, long before P2TR. Either because of they're in P2PK outputs, because they're in hashed addresses which have been reused and already using for spending, or because they're been spent in forked chains. There are likely substantially more BTC in outputs whose public keys are known to multiple parties (multisig, lightning channels, escrow services, ...) but not to the entire world.\n\nI certainly agree there is no urgency right now, but if (and only if) cryptography-breaking QCs become a reality, the ecosystem has no choice but disabling(*) the spending of coins through schemes that become broken, and n",

In such a scenario, it could be highly beneficial for parties that benefit from high fees to flood the network with bogus transactions to force the fees arbitrarily high, since people would then be forced to either pay exorbitant fees to move their funds by the deadline, or lose their funds entirely. As such, this does not seem like a good idea in general, at least unless the transition period is extremely long (say 10 years or more).\n\nA less drastic proposal could be to (at least initially) only disable spending from the less common outputs that have no inherent quantum resistance by virtue of having a hashed public key, such as P2PK and P2TR, while leaving the safer variants with hashed public keys like P2PKH and P2WPKH spendable. Most analyses of quantum algorithms I have read suggest that at least initially, they would take a significant amount of time to calculate a private key even if the public key is known, which means that even if there were a quantum breakthrough, there should be a relatively low chance of having funds intercepted between broadcasting it (which would of course reveal the public key) and having it included in a block. Furthermore, there would always be the option of only revealing the transaction to a trusted miner rather than broadcasting it, foregoing the risk entirely.\n\nUTXOs with hashed public keys might still need to be disabled at some point, seeing as a non-insignificant number of them have a revealed public key due to address reuse, and that quantum computers might eventually reach the point where the chance of breaking a private key after broadcasting but before block inclusion is non-insignificant, but this should at least alleviate the initial rush of disabling everything at once.\n\n--\nBest,\nArmchairCryptologist\n\nOn Sunday, March 9th, 202",

These schemes exhibit significant storage overheads, hindering \ntheir practical application. This paper introduces ESSPI, an optimized \nmethod leveraging ECDSA/Schnorr signatures to sign the BitVMX program \ninput. With Schnorr signatures we achieve an optimal 1:1 data expansion, \ncompared to the current known best ratio of 1:200 based on Winternitz \nsignatures. To accomplish this we introduce 4 innovations to BitVMX: (1) a \nmodification of the BitVMX CPU, adding a challengeable hashing core to it, \n(2) a new partition-based search to detect fraud during hashing, (3) a new \nenhanced transaction DAG with added data-carrying transactions with a \nfraud-verifying smart-contract and (4) a novel timelock-based method for \nproving data availability to Bitcoin smart contracts. The enhanced BitVMX \nprotocol enables the verification of uncompressed inputs such as SPV \nproofs, NiPoPoWs, or longer computation integrity proofs, such as STARKs.\n\nBest, Sergio.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/3e49d257-7d44-4c19-a157-eb479ca0a4b9n%40googlegroups.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #1.2: Type: text/html, Size: 2146 bytes --]",

The proposed improvements are motivated\nfor diverse reasons detailed subsequently. Currently, there has been 2 draft\nBIPs proposed [0] [1]. A modular overhaul of the transaction-relay protocol\nwas already discussed few years ago [2].\n\n## Problems\n\nAs a reminder, the Bitcoin transaction-relay protocol in its simple flow \n(i.e\nno package and no erlay) for inter-node single transaction communication \nworks\nin the following rough way:\n- a wallet do an initial broadcast of a new tx to a node A\n- node A do an INV(MSG_TX, TXID) message to node B\n- node B replies with GETDATA(MSG_TX, TXID)\n- node A forwards the new transaction with a TX message\n\nAs far as I know, the transaction-relay protocol as work in the following\nway since the very first releases of the original bitcoin software. There is\nindeed a myriad of other subtleties that have been added in the time, for \ngood\nreasons, here go to see a full-node codebase.\n\nThis approach comes up with a number of practical problems.\n\n## 1. Transaction-Relay as Denial-of-Service Vector\n\nThere could be scenarios where puppets peers are deliberately sending junk\ntransactions traffic that is burdening a target node CPU time [3] [4]. In my\nunderstanding, this is not necessarily one of the most concerning DoS risk\naffecting Bitcoin full-nodes partaking in in the transaction-relay network,\nhowever this can be still concerning.\n\n## 2. Transaction-Propagation Deanonymization Vector\n\nSome gap in the current transaction-relay protocol allows mass-connectors\nto broadcast transactions without first sending an INV message. Indeed, \ncurrent\nbitcoin core software accepts a raw TX message, even if has not been paired \nby\nan INV or asked for by a GETDATA. Exploiting this behavior, mass-connectors\ncan bypass tx-relay timers to gather more information on the \ntransaction",

That gives you an efficient \nrepresentation, compatibility with other software, a compact checksum, \nand local policy.\n\nFor the later point, policy being local, there exists software[1] that I \nbelieve has a moderate userbase (including possibly some miner support) \nthat implements less restrictive standard transaction rules than Bitcoin \nCore, specifically allowing OP_RETURN outputs of more than 83 bytes \ncumulative.[2]  If a user of your software runs that node and believes \nhis transactions will relay to a compatible miner, what options does he \nhave of circumventing BOSD type 0's limit of 80 push bytes if one of his \nusers wants to send him such a data carrier output?  He can propose a \ntype 5, but you'll probably reject that because >80 bytes will be \nnon-standard for other users.  You can create an extension numeric \nrange, but then you'll have to centrally coordinate number assignment \nfor every random proposal.  Instead, I think it makes more sense to not \nuse versioning at all and just perform local verification on raw() \ndescriptors; that way users of your software can modify one line of code \non their side to accept >80 bytes and everyone else can use the default \ntests.\n\nIn addition to the above technical criticism, I find the BOSD name \nextremely conflationary with the longstanding use of \"output script \ndescripto",

I'm consistently seeing unconfirmed transactions from months ago being rebroadcast and (now that the mempool is draining) eventually confirming, without anyone even trying to exploit anything. So from what I can tell, the only thing this really accomplishes is wasting CPU cycles and bandwidth evicting and later re-accepting the transactions in question.\n\nAll it would take is one person running a rebroadcasting service to make\nmempool eviction useless except in the rare case that a soft-fork of\nstandard transactions has happened. Although even then, arguably you are\nbetter off not wasting bandwidth re-accepting those transactions over\nand over again.\n\n> You were never able to rely on unconfirmed transactions ever going away without double-spending one of the inputs in the first place, and full-RBF is even a thing now, so this will always be possible.\n\nAgreed.\n\n> The mempool is capped by size anyway, so while I may be missing something, I cannot honestly see any good reasons to keep this mechanism at all, especially if it can be used as a vector for attacks.\n>\n> The only drawback I can think of is that abandontransaction currently does not work if a transaction is in the mempool, but it would probably be better to improve it so it actually evicts the transaction from the mempool of the local node if necessary.\n\nAgreed.
