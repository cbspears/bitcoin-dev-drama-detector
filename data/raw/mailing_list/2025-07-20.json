Howewer, to my \nunderstanding, the proposal clearly lacks solid foundations, and although \nit tries to anticipate some objections, the responses offered are either \ninsufficient or even counterproductive.\n\n1) The issue of miner incentives is overstated\nThe last bitcoin won’t be mined until the year 2140, which means we’re \nstill more than 100 years away. Justifying such a structural change today \nbased on a concern that lies completely outside our current technical, \nsocial, and economic horizon is an exaggeration. As rewards decrease, \nBitcoin has already shown a natural tendency to substitute them with \ntransaction fees, without this causing any systemic collapse.\n\n2) Artificial scarcity is not a problem (it’s part of the design)\nBitcoin is divisible into 100 million satoshis per unit, which provides \nmore than enough granularity to operate even if BTC reaches astronomical \nvalues. If 1 BTC were worth more than 1 million u$s, each satoshi would be \nworth over a cent. If necessary, an extension of decimals could be \nconsidered in the future (as is already done in Lightning with \nmillisatoshis), without altering the fundamental rules.\n\nThe idea that “lost value must be recovered” to maintain liquidity \ncompletely ignores the fact that in a deflationary economy, the loss of \nunits doesn’t necessarily reduce system functionality—it increases the \nvalue of the remaining units. In the words of Satoshi Nakamoto himself:\n“Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of \nit as a donation to everyone.” (I clarify that i do not necessarily \nintended to be canonical)\n\n3) The confiscation risk doesn't disappear just because it's framed as \n\"reauthentication.\"\nThe argument that “if you can’t move your coins for 20 years, it’s \nindistinguish",

They \nhighlight important edge cases, particularly around long-term inheritance \nplanning and time-locked contracts, that deserve further discussion.\n\nThe intent of this proposal is not to seize anyone’s Bitcoin but to create \na rules-based mechanism for reintroducing truly abandoned coins—those \nlocked away forever due to lost keys—back into the economy. If a private \nkey is irrecoverably lost, the associated Bitcoin is effectively removed \nfrom circulation and, arguably, no longer owned. In such cases, the \nso-called \"security tax\" affects no active participant.\n\nThat said, your concerns are valid. One potential refinement would be to \nextend the inactivity window significantly—perhaps even to 100 years—to \nbetter accommodate multi-generational ownership and time-locked smart \ncontracts. The core idea is that a sufficiently long timeframe, paired with \nclear expectations and wallet alerts, can strike a balance between \npreserving ownership rights and sustaining economic viability.\n\nIt's also possible that this proposal—or one like it—may only be \nrealistically implemented as part of a broader hard fork in the distant \nfuture, potentially bundled with other critical changes such as \npost-quantum security upgrades. I hope that when that moment comes, a \nmechanism for reclaiming permanently lost coins is part of that discussion.\n\nTo those who object on purely ideological grounds, I would offer this \nreflection: if something can happen, it will happen—and it will continue to \nhappen. People will keep losing keys. And one day, someone will lose the \nprivate key to the very last satoshi. Long before that point, Bitcoin may \nbecome functionally unusable—not because of inflation like fiat currencies, \nbut due to irreversible deflation and economic ossification.\n\nIn that light, maintaining the myth that permanently lost coins should \nr",

This \napplies to both freezing and commit/reveal schemes; the latter may result \nin lost funds if the public key is leaked. I realized that this also \napplies to the commit/reveal scheme I proposed in another thread [1].\n\nThe idea is to *roll out such forks incrementally across the UTXO set*. \nInstead of freezing or constraining all UTXOs at once, we split the UTXO \nset into 256 groups deterministically (for example, by looking at the first \nbyte of the TXID) and apply the constraints over 256 days, processing one \ngroup per day. Procrastinators will learn what is happening through word of \nmouth, act to save their funds, and only a small percentage of coin owners \nwill be harmed.\n\nAnother approach is to *provide a temporary opt-out option*. If someone \nfinds themselves blocked, they would still have a limited time to take an \naction, without requiring any extra knowledge, to get unblocked. This would \nhelp raise awareness. After being temporarily blocked and recovering their \nfunds through the opt-out mechanism, the person would understand that they \nneed to take further steps with their remaining coins to avoid being \npermanently blocked once the opt-out period ends. The action to unblock the \nfunds could be as simple as sending a transaction with OP_RETURN \"opt-out \n<txid>\", which would enable the old acceptance rules for the transaction \nwith that txid for a period of 2016 blocks.\n\n\n[1] https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uUK6py0Yjq0/m/57bQJ3VSCQAJ\nIn that scheme if the pubkey is leaked, anyone can post a valid commitment \nwith a random TXID blocking the coin forever.\n\nBest,\nBoris\n\nOn Saturday, July 12, 2025 at 9:46:09 PM UTC-3 Jameson Lopp wrote:\n\nBuilding upon my earlier essay against allowing quantum recovery of bitcoin \n<https://grou",

Tim Ruffing, Yannick\nSeurin and I recently published DahLIAS, the first interactive aggregate\nsignature scheme with constant-size signatures (64 bytes) compatible with\nsecp256k1.\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2025/692.pdf\n\nRecall that in an aggregate signature scheme, each signer contributes their own\nmessage, which distinguishes it from multi- and threshold signatures, where all\nsigners sign the same message. This makes aggregate signature schemes the\nnatural cryptographic primitive for cross-input signature aggregation because\neach transaction input typically requires signing a different message.\n\nPrevious candidates for constant-size aggregate signatures either:\n- Required cryptographic assumptions quite different from the discrete logarithm\n   problem on secp256k1 currently used in Bitcoin signatures (e.g., groups with\n   efficient pairings).\n- Were \"folklore\" constructions, lacking detailed descriptions and security\n   proofs.\n\nBesides presenting DahLIAS, the paper provides a proof that a class of these\nfolklore constructions are indeed secure if the signer does _not_ use key\ntweaking (e.g., no Taproot commitments or BIP 32 derivation). Moreover, we show\nthat there exists a concrete attack against a folklore aggregate signature\nscheme derived from MuSig2 when key tweaking is used.\n\nIn contrast, DahLIAS is proven to be compatible with key tweaking. Moreover, it\nrequires two rounds of communication for signing, where the first round can be\nrun before the messages to be signed are known. Verification of DahLIAS\nsignatures is asymptotically twice as fast as half-aggregate Schnorr signatures\nand as batch verification of individual Schnorr signatures.\n\nWe believe DahLIAS offers an attractive building block for a potential CISA\nproposal and welcome any feedback or discussion.\n\nJonas Nick, Tim Ruffing, Yannick Seurin\n\n\n[0] See, e.",

A quantum computing threat materializes suddenly and Bitcoin does not\nhave quantum safe signatures as part of the protocol.

For those not familiar with Or's approach, it would share many of the same properties as the folklore BIP39 zk-STARK approach discussed elsewhere. It uses Picnic in the same way, to prove (in zero-knowledge) either:\n\n\n-   (For UTXOs whose pubkeys are exposed) I know a BIP39 seed that derives an EC secret key such that `hash160(pubkey(ec_secret)) == <hash>`\n-   (For UTXOs whose pubkeys are still secret) I know a public key such that `hash160(pubkey) == <hash>`\n    \n\n\n\nFrom Or's paper, section 2.5:\n\n\n> Spending Hashed UTXOs: To spend a hashed UTXO, the user signs it with a key-lifted signature (see Section 2.2).\n> \n\n> Spending Derived UTXOs: To spend a derived UTXO, the user signs it with a seed-lifted signature (see Section 2.3).\n\n\n\nI see a couple problems with this. We won't be able to straight-up replace the EC signature with a Picnic signature without a hard fork. Old Bitcoin clients will still need to see a valid EC signature and verify `hash160(pubkey) == <hash>` by classical re-computation. This exposes the EC pubkey, which would let a QC attacker forge new key-lifted signatures. Thus, sadly, we can't rely on key-lifted signatures.\n\n\nThat said, we don't always require a hard fork as you note in the paper. It's totally fine to expose the EC signature and pubkey if we also have a way to prove honest derivation of the EC secret key from a seed, and as long as that proof commits to the same transaction. Either seed-lifted Picnic signatures or ZK-STARKs could satisfy this. To get soft-fork backwards-compatibility, we'd introduce a new transaction data field to carry the proof, much like segwit added the witness data field. Then we require new clients to reject any EC signatures unless accompanied by this \"proof-of-seed-derivation\". Old clients still see valid EC spend TXs. Soft fork achieved.\n\nAs for the \"Lifted FawkesCoin\" commit/reveal protocol, it has some issues. I t",

Since it has been more \nthan a year since the new BIP Editors were added, it seems like a good \ntime to take a look back.\n\nThe 5 new BIP Editors were added in April of last year. In the time \nsince, the BIPs repository has seen a lot more action and the addition \nof new BIP Editors seems to me to be quite successful.\n\nIn the 15 months prior to adding the new BIP Editors, the BIP Editors had:\n- Left 80 comments\n- Merged 44 PRs\n- Closed 6 PRs\n- Assigned 4 BIP numbers\n\nIn the 15 months since adding the new BIP Editors, the BIP Editors have:\n- Left 1272 comments\n- Merged 261 PRs\n- Closed 122 PRs\n- Assigned 22 BIP numbers\n\nThis improvement is very much welcome and the BIPs process no longer \nfeels stuck.\n\nThat being said, there is significant variance in the activity of the \nEditors, with only a couple Editors accounting for the vast majority of \nthe aforementioned activity. This raises the question of whether all of \nthe current BIP Editors want to dedicate their time to serving the \ncommunity in this role, and whether there are others who could take \ntheir place as well.\n\nThanks,\nAva\n\n[1]: https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/cuMZ77KEQAA/m/hplkMlcmBwAJ\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/8285fb0c-119b-42b8-a530-194650b87ebe%40achow101.com.",

          "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nTo mitigate high block validation time, BIP54 proposes to make transactions which require more than\n2500 legacy signature operations invalid by consensus. The 2500 figure was chosen as the tightest\nvalue that did not make any non-pathological currently standard transaction invalid.\n\nNo transaction in Bitcoin's history would have both hit the BIP54 sigop limit and been standard\naccording to today's Bitcoin Core policy[^0]. But what happened in the past doesn't matter as much\nas the fact that it is possible today to create a pathological standard transaction that is\nBIP54-invalid.\n\nThis opens up a major DoS vector against unupgraded miners if BIP54 ever gets activated in these\nconditions. Therefore i propose to make such transactions non-standard and hold off activation of\nBIP54 until we have good reasons to believe that the vast majority of the hashrate won't create a\nblock containing such a transaction.\n\nDoing so gives better guarantees in case BIP54 is ever considered for activation, and comes at\nvirtually no cost since these pathological transactions have never been used and serve no purpose\nbeyond increasing the cost of validation. Bitcoin Core PR #32521 implements this change, which i\nhope to get into the upcoming 30.0 release as well as backported to previous versions.\n\nBest,\nAntoine Poinsot\n\n[^0]: Here the full list of historical transactions that would have hit the BIP54 sigops limit:\n    - 659135664894e50040830edb516a76f704fd2be409ecd8d1ea9916c002ab28a2\n    - bea1c2b87fee95a203c5b5d9f3e5d0f472385c34cb5af02d0560aab973169683\n    - 24b16a13c972522241b65fbb83d09d4bc02ceb33487f41d1f2f620b047307179\n    - 53666009e036171b1aee099bc9cd3cb551969a53315410d13ad5390b8b4f3bd0\n    - ffc178be118bc2f9eaf016d1c942aec18441a6c5ec17c9d92d1da7962f0479f6\n    - 2f1654561297114e434c4aea5ca715e4e3f10be0be8c1c9db2b6f68ea76dae09\n    - 62fc8d091a7c597783981f00b889d72d24ad5e3e224dbe1c2a317aabef89217e\n    - d939315b180d3d73b5e316eb57a18f8137a3f5943aef21a811660d25f1080a3f\n   ",

Thus, \nrelease of consensus layer for RGB had required us to build its complete \nfunctionality, which is kind of ossified from the day of the release, with \na very small surface for possible future changes or upgrades.\n\nAnyway, here we are: finally the protocol is complete, with all required \nfunctionality (including support for zk-STARK compression) being present \nthere. Adding zk-STARK support was quite a challenge, which took most of \nthe last year, and required to re-think and re-do the virtual machine and \nthe full computing environment which was used by RGB. You can read the full \ninformation about what’s coming with the released consensus layer in the \nofficial release \nannouncement: https://rgb.tech/blog/release-v0-12-consensus/\n\nThose who are interested about more details what RGB is, may also watch my \npresentation at the past BTC Pragure RGB \nside-event: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34QcP2GMMU\n\nNB: This is a consensus layer release, with standard library and \napplication-level library releases to follow during the next weeks. \nHowever, this release is the most important among all of them, since it is \nonly consensus changes which can break contracts backward compatibility, \nwhile the changes to any layers on top may require software or wallet \nupdates – ",

The reason to use \nMuHash is to avoid quadratic hashing, by only needing to iterate through \nthe input set once. Our goal is simply to prove that an indexed set of \nsibling prevouts is committed to.\n\nIn the naive implementation, validating a sibling commitment requires \nhashing all other prevouts in the transaction. In the worst case, this is \nO(n^2) if we need to validate a sibling commitment for each input.\n\nWith MuHash, this becomes O(n) because we can validate sibling commitments \nby precomputing a hash over all prevouts and then selectively removing one \nprevout, which is O(1). This gives us the same result as directly hashing \nthe sibling prevouts.\n\nDoes this address your concern?\n\nBest,\nJosh\n\nOn Thursday, July 10, 2025 at 8:10:47 AM UTC-4 Greg Sanders wrote:\n\nHi Josh,\n\nFor one, MuHash doesn't have a compact membership proof, for one, making it \nunlikely to be useful for anything we're likely thinking of.

Note: protecting against short-exposure attacks\n   requires PQ signatures.\n   5.\n\n   P2QRH gives us similar functionality as the much discussed option of\n   disabling key-spends in P2TR on Q-Day (when quantum attacks become\n   practical), but with the added benefit that the ecosystem can upgrade well\n   before Q-Day. This removes the risks of attempting a consensus change\n   during an emergency or acting too late.\n\n\nWe moved PQ signatures specification out of BIP-360 so that P2QRH can be\ndebated independently of the debate over PQ signature algorithms.

One of those shortcomings was the difficulty reset creating havoc. [0] In spite of this a similar rule was adopted for testnet4. [1] As a result, testnet4 is similarly creating havoc. [2]\n\nThe goal of testnet is to mimic the Bitcoin mainnet. This is why it is useful to have in addition to a more control testing environment such as Signet.\n\nThe given rationale for a difficulty reset was to let developers occasionally mine blocks on their laptop. But you cannot have your cake and eat it too: either the network is permissionless (PoW) or you assign identities and privileges to some (Signet). By trying to do both at the same time testnet4 created a loophole for abuse. As a result it failed on both count: it neither mimics mainnet nor allows developers to mine active blocks on their laptop.\n\nI propose to fix this by removing the difficulty reset rule from testnet4 through a flag day hard fork on 2026-01-01. I picked a date well in the future to minimize disruption. This leaves enough time for a patch to be reviewed, merged, included in the next major Bitcoin Core release, backported to previous releases and adopted by the infrastructure running on testnet4. That should be enough for a test network.\n\nLet me know what you think,\nAntoine\n\n[0] https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CADL_X_eXjbRFROuJU0b336vPVy5Q2RJvhcx64NSNPH-3fDCUfw@mail.gmail.com\n[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0094.mediawiki#rule-specification\n[2] [https://fork.observer](https://fork.observer/) - pick the network on the top right corner\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/hU75",

A simple rule, like \"any block time greater than 20 minutes is\ninvalid (except difficulty adjustment, where it has ASIC difficulty)\" would\nforce the difficulty to drop to its real value. Currently mined CPU blocks\ncan be accepted by existing nodes, and can be rejected by soft-forked ones,\nand if the hashrate majority will keep reorging everything, what CPU miners\nproduced, then it would work.\n\nBecause in general, if the difficulty can never raise or drop by more than\nfour times, then maybe block times should also not differ by more than 20\nminutes? Maybe using 40 minutes instead would be more aligned with this\nrule, but then, CPU-mined blocks would still be enforced, so that's the\nreason behind picking 20 minutes. And also, during difficulty adjustment,\nthe real time can be put in block headers, so clocks can be properly\nsynchronized every two weeks.\n\nAnother thing is, if someone doesn't want to be flooded by CPU-mined\nblocks, then that node operator can observe only ASIC blocks today, and\ncount confirmations only in them. Everything, what CPU miners produce, can\nbe considered unconfirmed in practice, because a single ASIC block can\nreorg millions of CPU-mined blocks anyway.\n\nsob., 17 maj 2025 o 07:11 Saint Wenhao <saintwenhao@gmail•com> napisał(a):\n\n> > I think mining a more-work chain than testnet4 would require about the\n> same amount of hash that it would take to mine ~13 mainnet blocks at the\n> current difficulty, so you'd be giving up about $4M USD in mainnet block\n> rewards to do it.\n>\n> If you want to have permissionless mining, then you don't care that much,\n> when the chain will be reorganized.

In this case the only thing an attacker \nneeds is to acquire 2 BTC. They would also earn fees from coinjoin being a \nmaker.\n\nIndeed hedging is something to consider when analyzing cost of timelocking \ncoins. It's not obvious what its effect is, but it certainly doesn't remove \nthe \"opportunity cost\"/\"sacrifice\" (i.e. the cost derived from the time \nvalue of money), and thus doesn't invalidate the idea of using a timelock \nto create a nontrivial cost to attack the system. What it does it remove \none aspect of cost, which comes from the volatility in the \"true value\" \n(however you want to measure that, e.g. purchasing power) of the asset \n(here, 1 BTC), but with the additional cost of locking more capital (and \ntransaction costs, and ..). But with or without hedging, the *main* aspect \nof cost remains: you forego the opportunity to use those funds otherwise, \nduring the locked period; the monetary value of that opportunity cost is a \nlot less than the 1 BTC, of course, for only 3 months, but it is a lot \ngreater than zero.\n\nOn to calculating costs:\n\nIn this other part of my reply, I wrote:\n\n> Just a pure \"I own a utxo\" imposes no, or negligible cost. As per the \ndelving post, and in a few other places, I've noted you can impose an age \nand value restriction to bump up the cost.\n\nSo your idea of calculating that is certainly something I considered, \nthough, how exactly one constructs the right kind of formula isn't that \nobvious. I had something like age^a * value ^ b whereas you are looking at \nstraight multiplication in your linked gitlab note  (so I guess a=1, b=1) \n(also you weight by utxo type, but I guess that's a very small delta). I \nhave no real clue for now what the correct formula is; but in any case, we \nagree there.\n\n>",

A PR resolving this discrepancy by moving that test \nfrom the invalid to the valid section was merged, but there is still a \nquestion of whether this was the right course of action.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin Core does not implement this, and AFAICT, neither \ndoes rust-miniscript. There is an open PR to Bitcoin Core to allow `H` \n(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32788), but ongoing discussion \nsuggests that perhaps the BIP should be modified instead as it seems \nprobable that no implementation of descriptors allows `H`.\n\nSo the question is: are there any implementations of descriptors that \nemit descriptors that use `H` as a hardened indicator, or permit `H` as \na hardened indicator?\n\nI think the former question is more useful to know as it is more \nimportant that the descriptor implementations can parse each other's \nproducts. It is possible that there are implementations that allow `H` \nbut do not emit `H`, since there are libraries that provide BIP 32 \nutilities which allow `H`.\n\nThanks\nAva\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/848d3d4b-94a5-4e7c-b178-62cf5015b65f%40achow101.com.",

Schoolbook Winternitz\none-time signatures, forest-of-trees few-time signatures, and Merkle trees\nall validate signatures (/authentication paths) by recomputing the public\nkey (/Merkle tree root) from the signature and the message, and checking\nwhether the recomputed public key matches the actual public key. That means\nwe can pick anything for the signature, and just set the public key to the\nrecomputed public key.\n\nThe situation is more subtle for actual standardized hash-based signatures.\nRFC 8391 XMSS doesn’t sign the message itself, but first hashes in (among\nothers) the public key. Basically the best we can do for XMSS (except for\nsetting the signature randomizer) is to guess the public key. Thus it’s\npretty much jpeg resistant.\n\nThe situation is different again for RFC 8391 XMSSMT. XMSSMT is basically a\ncertificate chain of XMSS signatures. An XMSSMT public key is an XMSS\npublic key. An XMSSMT signature is a chain of XMSS signatures: the XMSSMT\npublic key signs another XMSS public key; which signs another public XMSS\npublic key; …; which signs the message. Again the top XMSSMT public key is\nhashed into the message signed, but that only binds the first XMSS\nsignature. We can’t mess with the first signature, but the other signatures\nwe can choose freely, as those roots are not bound. Thus XMSSMT with two\nsubtrees is only half jpeg resistant and it gets worse with more subtrees.\n\nSimilarly SLH-DSA (FIPS 205, née SPHINCS+) is a certificate chain of (a\nvariant of) XMSS signing another XMSS public key, which si",

This can result in perceived \n\"disappearance\" or \"freezing\" of funds, and is especially problematic for \nprivacy-focused or air-gapped users who do not maintain full mempool logs.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal**\n\nI propose a new opt-in mechanism called the *Self-Verifiable Transaction \nBroadcast Log*. When enabled, this feature would:\n\n- Record any transaction that a node accepts for broadcast (via P2P or \nRPC), along with a timestamp and source;\n- Optionally allow filtering by address or wallet;\n- Provide a new RPC call (e.g., `getbroadcastedtxs`) to retrieve this \ninformation;\n- Help users and wallets verify that a transaction existed — even if it was \nlater dropped, reorganized, or not confirmed.\n\nThis does not change any consensus behavior, and the log can be locally \nmanaged and purged by the user.

I don't think anyone wants\na commit/reveal protocol to become the sole primary method of\ntransferring BTC.\n\nWe're more or less designing a system for a wallet which wakes up\nafter a years-long coma to find quantum computers are a threat.\nThis wallet can make a single \"commitment transaction\" followed\nby a single \"reveal transaction\", and this dance moves all of\nthe funds in the wallet to a new (yet to be defined)\nquantum-resistant script. After that, sending Bitcoin should work\nmostly as normal.\n\nEven if you're still hard-line opposed to the idea of\nrequiring a post-quantum UTXO to recover pre-quantum UTXOs,\nit's still completely possible to use commit/reveal protocols\nwithout out-of-band purchase of new BTC: You can simply spend\na very small pre-quantum UTXO to create the commitment. A UTXO\nworth only a few thousand sats, for instance. This would be\nuneconomical for the quantum attacker to double spend, and\nso you'd most likely get your commitment mined safely without\nbuying new BTC. The only situation in which this is not possible\nwould be for a party with only very high-value pre-quantum UTXOs,\nand no small UTXOs. These parties would need to buy a new (small)\nUTXO out-of-band.\n\nregards,\nconduition\n\n\nOn Wednesday, June 4th, 2025 at 2:56 AM, Jonathan Voss <k98kurz@gmail•com> wrote:\n\n> If using a monetary network requires out-of-band payments, then that severely limits the actual utility of the monetary network as a medium of exchange. Imagine if the only way to make a bank transfer was to first go in-person to the bank of the recipient of the transfer to give them something that then allowed your bank to make the transfer -- it would be an unworkable monetary system.

However it isn't really possible to cross-check\nthe quality of the initial random generation.  Some people are going to\nprefer to generate that randomness by hand in a fully transparent process\nand not hidden within some computer chip using a noisy transistor or\nwhatever.\n\nOnce again, I want to reiterate for this thread that there already exists a\nBIP for a hand-computable friendly master secret format, which is BIP-93\n(codex32).  Yes, hand computing the checksum for BIP-93 is a pain, but\nunlike BIP-39's checksum, it is actually doable.  And unlike BIP-39's\nchecksum, the checksum for codex32 is actually an error-correcting code, so\nyou can actually repair errors and erasures in the data.  It is even\npossible to use an untrusted computer to repair your codex32 string so that\nthe computer learns practically zero information about your secret or\nsecret share.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/CAMZUoKnzDf0hMC-i4Xis3GXW96fWRwJgKSzzcj5aqGg3zGM8Kg%40mail.gmail.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #2: Type: text/html, Size: 2567 bytes -",
