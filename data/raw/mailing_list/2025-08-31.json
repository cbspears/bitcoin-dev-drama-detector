This allows wallets to derive codex32 \nbackups from BIP-0032 master keys.\n\n*Summary* \n\n   - \n   \n   Application number: 93'\n   - Derivation path: \n   m/83696968'/93'/{hrp}'/{threshold}'/{n}'/{byte_length}'/{id0}'/{id1}'/{id2}'/{id3}'/{index}' \n   \nCodex32, defined in BIP-93, is a human-readable encoding with checksumming \nand share indexing designed for SSS backups of BIP-0032 seeds. This PR \nproposes a deterministic way to generate codex32 strings using BIP-85.\n\n*Rationale* \n\n   - \n   \n   Mirrors the existing BIP-85 application for BIP-39.\n   - \n   \n   Codex32 offers error correction, hand verification, identifiers, and \n   secret sharing features compared to BIP-39.\n   - \n   \n   Adds a standardized way for wallets to generate codex32 backups from \n   BIP-85-derived entropy\n   - \n   \n   Test vectors and reference implementation are linked to in the PR.\n   \n*Risks and alternatives* \n\n   - \n   \n   Wallet adoption of codex32 is still limited, though a draft PR #32652 \n   <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32652?utm_source=chatgpt.com> \n   for importing codex32 strings to Bitcoin Core has support.\n   - Codex32 implementers could use the BIP-85 dice application, but \n   defining a direct application improves interoperability.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/compare/master...BenWestgate:bips:codex32 \n<https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/compare/master...BenWestgate:bips:codex32?utm_source=chatgpt.com>\n\nFeedback is welcome.\nBest regards,\nBen Westgate\n\n-- \nYou received this message bec",

Four entries were added to the\n[wiki][1] and nobody has any objections to the proposals. Some\norganizations do not want to publicly participate in this process to avoid\npolitics and drama.\n\nA [letter][2] was signed on 9 June 2025 by bitcoin developers to get more\ncore contributors involved in the review process. It was followed by a\n[proposal][3] that makes a few changes to CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY and combines\nit with CHECKSIGFROMSTACK. Personally, I don't like that TEMPLATEHASH is\nrestricted to taproot and don't see anything wrong with\nCHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. However, other developers may disagree with me and\nhave different opinion. I have created an IRC channel for workshops,\nmeetings, activation, etc.\n\nWe can finalize a meeting schedule so we can use the IRC channel to move\ncloser to covenants activation on bitcoin.\n\nI think BIP 8 would be a better option for the next soft fork.\n[Previously][4], some suggestions were [rejected][5] because knots was not\nused by a large number of users. However, things have changed since then\nand [~15%][6] of nodes use knots for bitcoin.\n\n[0]: https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/kd8g8V1NVOY/m/nE2y5V66AQAJ\n[1]: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Covenants_support\n[2]: https://ctv-csfs.com/\n[3]: https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/5wLThgegha4/m/iUWIZPIaCAAJ\n[4]:\nhttps://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CAFvNmHS4s_MbXP8o3kWmaUZ5Xks1b76jSDymp1Bjr--4R8_v3Q@mail.gmail.com/\n[5]:\nhttps://diyhpl.us/cgit/pi-bitcoindev/plain/cc/877bbc8de83e7aa4d2252a0473d05d634946b4/dev/fd0\n[6]: https://bitnodes.io/nodes/?q=knots#network-snapshot\n\n/dev/fd0\nfloppy disk guy\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiv",

          "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nWanted to share our recent work on \"Glock\" (Garbled Locks) for optimistic smart contract verification on bitcoin. This is pretty similar in concept to Jeremy Rubin's work on Delbrag [0] and Robin Linus' work on BitVM3(RSA/s) [1,2], but uses different techniques to make a practical scheme. We have (linked below) a preprint that describes the scheme in detail and a research implementation under active development. We've been working on this for a long time, and I think some of techniques might be of independent interest.\n\nA \"Glock\" is a protocol for optimistic smart contract verification using Garbled Circuits. The \"Garbler\" signs the input (and proof) using a kind of Lamport-like signature and then the \"Evaluator\" can derive a secret if the smart contract fails, which they can use to sign a slashing transaction. This works with bitcoin today with no soft forks and is nice because it moves essentially all of the cost and complexity of verification off chain.\n\nIn theory, the fraud proof can literally be a Schnorr signature. Previous constructions either used something like Rubin's Grug tehcnique, which requires a larger slashing script, or had impractical costs for garbling. We propose the first (imo) practical Glock whose fraud proof is a single signature, which represents over a 550x reduction [4] of on-chain data compared to BitVM2 [3].\n\nOur protocol, Glock25, uses a bunch of interesting cryptography to make all the costs of the scheme manageable. We propose a new SNARK, which is currently the smallest known SNARK, make it designated verifier, and instantiate it with binary elliptic curves. These curves have some really nice synergies with the GC scheme. We also have some neat tricks to use adaptor signatures and verifiable secret sharing for efficient malicious security.\n\nPaper here:\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1485\n\nCode here:\n* Rust implementation of DV-Pari: github.com/alpenlabs/dv-pari\n* Binary circuit generator for DV-Pari: github.com/alpenlabs",

You are correct that the high-level goal of \nachieving quantum resilience is shared between our proposal and the earlier \none from Lopp et al. (co-authored by the Pauli Group). However, the \ncritical differentiator lies not in the \"what\" but in the \"when\" and the \n\"why\"—factors that fundamentally impact Bitcoin's security and stability.\n\nThe primary shortcoming of the Pauli Group proposal is its alarmist and \ncommercially motivated urgency, which pushes for an accelerated timeline \nthat is misaligned with the cautious, evidence-based approach of \ninternational standards bodies. As the NIST Internal Report 8547 makes \nclear, the transition to PQC is a massive undertaking that requires careful \ncoordination across the entire cryptographic ecosystem, with a realistic \ntarget for completion set for 2035 [NIST.IR.8547.ipd, p.8, 18]. NIST \nexplicitly allows for the continued use of classical signatures for \nauthentication until quantum computers are actually available, advocating \nfor a managed transition that minimizes disruption [NIST.IR.8547.ipd, p.15].\n\nThe Pauli Group's timeline seems designed to create a false sense of \nemergency, likely to benefit their commercial interests in promoting \nspecific solutions. In contrast, our BIP is structured around NIST's \nwell-reasoned 2035 horizon. This provides the entire Bitcoin \necosystem—miners, wallet providers, exchanges, and users—with a realistic \nand achievable schedule for a complete and secure migration. It avoids the \nextreme risks of a rushed implementation, which could lead to critical \nvulnerabilities, and instead fosters a deliberate, stable, and globally \ncoordinated upgrade. Our proposal is not a duplicate; it is a necessary \ncorrection towards a timeline that prioritizes Bitcoin's long-term \ncryptographic integrity over the speculative urgency of a private entity.\n\n\n*Response to ArmchairCryptologist:",

When activated by wallet \nowners, covenant-only mode disables key-path spending and mandates \nscript-path spending, creating invisible transaction restrictions that only \nbecome apparent when violated. This mechanism provides an optional security \nlayer for high-value institutional Bitcoin holdings against unauthorized \naccess while maintaining transaction privacy until restrictions are \ntriggered.\n\n== Copyright ==\n\nThis BIP is licensed under the BSD 2-clause license.\n\n== Motivation ==\n\nHigh-profile Bitcoin holders, particularly institutional entities such as \nexchanges, face significant security risks. When attackers gain access to \nprivate keys, they can drain wallets with varying degrees of difficulty but \nultimately succeed. Current security measures are visible and can be \ncircumvented by sophisticated attackers.\n\nThis proposal creates an optional but irrevocable security mechanism where:\n\n# Wallet owners can voluntarily and irrevocably restrict future \ntransactions to predefined destination addresses\n# Once activated, unauthorized transfer attempts are automatically \nredirected to arbitration wallets\n# The restrictions remain completely invisible until triggered\n# Protected wallets appear identical to unprotected ones, preventing \nattacker preparation\n# The mechanism is entirely opt-in and cannot be forced upon any wallet\n\n== Specification ==\n\n=== Covenant-Only Taproot Output ===\n\nA covenant-only Taproot output extends stand",

It could be implemented as a hard fork OR as a consensus that quantum actors can legitimately move funds to safe addresses for protective custody and public good. It could even go forward with no consensuses at all since it is functionally equivalent to a quantum winner-takes-all at the protocol level.\n\nBIP: TBD\nTitle: Quantum Secure Asset Verification & Escrow (QSAVE)\nAuthor: James Tagg\nStatus: Draft\nType: Standards Track\nLayer: Consensus (Consensus / Soft Fork / Hard Fork)\nCreated:\nLicense:\n\nAbstract\n\nThis BIP proposes QSAVE (Quantum Secure Asset Verification & Escrow) - a non-sovereign wealth fund providing protective custody for Bitcoin vulnerable to quantum attack (see Appendix for detailed vulnerability assessment). QSAVE preserves 100% of the principal for rightful owners while using generated returns to fund the protocol and global public good. It provides an alternative to the QRAMP (Quantum Resistant Asset Migration Protocol) proposal (which makes coins unspendable) or taking no action (which allows quantum appropriation, which many view as theft). This proposal addresses coins that are dormant but acknowledges there may be coins that have quantum watermarks but have not migrated to quantum addresses. A separate BIP proposal will address this case.\n\nMotivation\n\nChain analysis reveals 3.5-5.5 million Bitcoin (~17-28% of circulating supply) have exposed public keys vulnerable to quantum attack (see Appendix: Quantum Vulnerability Assessment for detailed breakdown).\n\nWith sufficient education and proactive migration, a significant portion of the 2-4M BTC in reused addresses could be moved to quantum-safe addresses before the threat materializes. Modern wallets are increasingly implementing best practices such as always sending change to fresh addresses. However,",

Let them compete: if Apple decides \nto incorporate compatibility whit secp256k1, it will gain a competitive \nadvantage over Samsung (and vice versa), and if bitcoinization expands on a \nlarge scale, that advantage could become very significant. If the market \nperceives value in these functionalities, companies will be motivated to \nimplement them.\n\nAdding to Greg Tonoski´s point, Samsung demonstrated that the \"mobile HSM + \nsecp256k1\" approach is technically viable (its Blockchain Keystore/SDK \nexposes APIs capable of producing ECDSA/secp256k1 signatures on selected \nGalaxy devices). While the solution ended up fragmented by model/region and \ndependent on the vendor, there was concrete development.\n\nAlso, let's remember that Bitcoin is an open and permeable organization: \nanyone or any entity can add value, whether through software \nimplementations, specification development, or tool creation. When \ninterests and goals align, those contributions get integrated and \nmanufacturers to experiment with practical, real-world solutions before \nforcing consensus changes, wich tend to be lengthy, complex, and risky.\n\nBest regards,\nJavier Mateos\n\nEl viernes, 8 de agosto de 2025 a las 23:06:29 UTC-3, Josh Doman escribió:\n\n> Hi conduition, thanks for the thoughtful reply.

I think it's far from a crisis, but given the\ndifficulty in changing Bitcoin it's worth starting to seriously discuss.\nToday I wish to focus on a philosophical quandary related to one of the\ndecisions that would need to be made if and when we implement a quantum\nsafe signature scheme.\n\nSeveral Scenarios\nBecause this essay will reference game theory a fair amount, and there are\nmany variables at play that could change the nature of the game, I think\nit's important to clarify the possible scenarios up front.\n\n1. Quantum computing never materializes, never becomes a threat, and thus\neverything discussed in this essay is moot.\n2. A quantum computing threat materializes suddenly and Bitcoin does not\nhave quantum safe signatures as part of the protocol. In this scenario it\nwould likely make the points below moot because Bitcoin would be\nfundamentally broken and it would take far too long to upgrade the\nprotocol, wallet software, and migrate user funds in order to restore\nconfidence in the network.\n3.

Given a reveal TX, the validator wouldn't know if the commitment being opened was the earliest, because a miner could censor a reveal transaction for a block or two and insert a different one with a different set of inputs, resulting in a different HMAC key. \n\nThis is also the reason why my \"witness hashing\" idea won't work. The witness stack can be changed by a Quantum adversary after the reveal TX is opened, by inverting one of the pubkeys and making a fresh new signature. This changes the HMAC key that would've been used in an authentic commitment, and validators won't be able to check the commitment ordering. So we do still need to HMAC sign the TXID, and we have to do it on a per-input basis.\n\nWe can merge pubkeys into a single HMAC key as you suggested Boris, as long as we merge only the pubkeys within a single locking script of a specific reveal TX input. This way the HMAC key that we reveal to open any commitment is always the same, regardless of who tries to spend the revealed input. Taproot would be an exception since a P2TR address can have many possible locking scripts with different sets of pubkeys, but a quantum attacker probably won't be able to find them without inverting SHA256.\n\nThis means the reveal TX validator can find a clean ordering of past commitments for that reveal, and this thwarts any attacks from miners that rely on censoring the reveal TX.\n\nregards,\nconduition\nOn Saturday, August 9th, 2025 at 10:58 AM, 'conduition' via Bitcoin Development Mailing List <bitcoindev@googlegroups.com> wrote:\n\n> Hey Boris,\n> \n\n> \n\n> > I propose to simplify this by using just one MAC with all the pubkeys as a single key.

This is full demo code for now, though\nit got to the point where blocks can be downloaded from a vanilla bitcoind\npeer and the heap of C / Rust / CPP code built correctly on both ARM \n(Darwin) and x86_64 (Debian 12) platforms. The whole build system is\nstill a huge bunch of dirty hacks, but it's done without binding generator\nor whatever. That's good to keep the build toolchain strictly minimal.\n\nArchitecture is for now one main process (`backbone`) running the\nlibbitcoinkernel and orchestrating connections with traffic network\ndedicated process (`block-relay` and `addr-relay`). Configurations\nis very basic and I've not tested on all networks so far (reg, main,\ntest, etc).\n\nCode can be download here (head commit 689e9df60)\n\ngit clone git://bitcoinbackbone.org:/public-release.git\n\nFew lines of feedbacks on the libbitcoinkernel. First and foremost,\na pure C API is very fruitful for crossing the boundaries between\nthe different langages memory model. While in theory, you can e.g\nwrite your CPP code in Rust code, in practice a lot of CPP abstractions\ndoesn't map well equivalently in Rust (--or whatever other langs). For\nnow, hacked a custom C API on top of the libbitcoinkernel with basic\nblock processing and chainman init/shutdown, though the ideal one\nwould keep all the state on the CPP side. And allow multi-threaded\ncode access on top.\n\nSecond, while writing the block-relay process I figure out that\nfor some data structs one might be willing to check the syntax \nstructure of the headers by calling the libbitcoinkernel methods\nas pre-checks __before_ to pass full blocks to the main validation\none. So you could have multiple same-version shared libbitcoinkernel\ncode in you're different process, one with the chain state the other\n\"empty\".",

This has been suggested a few times, for example by Matt\nCorallo on this list [1]. Specifically, an upgrade path that adds post-\nquantum signatures to the scripting language in a first softfork, and\nlater, before a large-scale quantum computer is available, disables\nspending via Schnorr and ECDSA signatures in a second softfork, is\nsafe. \n\n### Wasn't this known already?\n\nIt appears to be a common assumption on this list that an attacker\ncan't break script-path spends. But I'm not aware that a convincing\njustification for this assumption has been presented by anyone before. \n\n### Can you quantify the results?\n\nA quantum attacker needs to perform at least 2^81 evaluations of SHA256\nto create a Taproot output and be able to open it to an unexpected\nMerkle root with probability 1/2.

That's why Blockchain Commons\nhas been working on  integrating FROST signing with Bitcoin transactions.\n\nWe now have a working demo, and we'll be showing it at our Gordian meeting\nnext Wednesday. You're invited!\n\n    WHAT? FROST in Bitcoin Gordian Meeting\n\n    WHEN? Wed., August 6th, 10am PDT\n\n    WHERE? Zoom (\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/88143195571?pwd=BVv4zCnnaNor97Vj8ayajh26yyICBr.1)\n\nAt the meeting, we'll be talking about the challenges of the integration,\nespecially concerning the need to \"tweak\" FROST signatures for use with\nTaproot. We think there are important architectural questions about which\nparty should be doing this and when, where security edges are critical, and\nthere may also be privacy concerns related to tweak technique. We'd love to\nget community input on all those questions. (We'll also be demonstrating\nhow our draft FROST cli tools work at our meeting!)\n\nThe ultimate object of our tool creation was to give developers a\nplayground, to experiment with FROST using a command line interface. It's a\nlearning method that we've found useful in our \"Learning Bitcoin From the\nCommand Line\" course (\nhttps://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line)\n, and we think you'll find this approach useful here too.\n\n(It's also just the first step. We hope to offer \"Learning FROST from the\nCommand Line\" and \"Learning BDK from the Command Line\" courses in the\nfuture. If you'd like to help sponsor these works, please let us know!)\n\nWe highly encourage wallet developers to attend so that we can give them\nall the tools they need to play with FROST. And, we hope to get domain\nexperts too, to help talk about the issues with tweaking FROST signatures\nfor use in Taproot!\n\nIf you want to know more about FROST, see our FROST developers page (\nhttps://developer.blockchaincomm",

Keeping \ninformation about unconfirmed transactions indefinitely is impractical \nand not useful to most nodes.\n\nI’m not sure I fully understand your motivation. If your transaction was \nvalid, but you cannot find any record of it, how do you know that it was \nvalid? How did you know to look for it? If your own node presents it to \nyou, your node has a copy of it that you can retrieve or rebroadcast. \nWere you the sender or recipient of this transaction? Is it possible \nthat someone created a payment to you that they later rescinded by \nreplacing the transaction?\n\nIf you have further questions, this topic might be a better fit for \ne.g., https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com instead of this mailing list.\n\nMurch\n\nOn 2025-06-16 02:57, wang wang wrote:\n> Dear Bitcoin developers,\n>\n> I’d like to propose a modest but meaningful improvement to Bitcoin \n> node software that addresses a real-world user issue involving \n> orphaned or dropped transactions: a local broadcast log for \n> transactions that a node has accepted and attempted to propagate.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **Background**\n>\n> There is currently no robust way for users to prove or verify that a \n> transaction was ever seen, accepted, or propagated by the Bitcoin \n> network — especially in cases where:\n>\n> - the transaction is not mined,\n> - it gets dropped from the mempool (e.g. due to eviction),\n> - or the transaction becomes part of a stale/orphaned block.\n>\n> In such cases, users who possess the private key for an address might \n> find no trace of their transaction on-chain or in the mempool — \n> effectively losing any record that it was ever broadcast.

          "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nTo mitigate high block validation time, BIP54 proposes to make transactions which require more than\n2500 legacy signature operations invalid by consensus. The 2500 figure was chosen as the tightest\nvalue that did not make any non-pathological currently standard transaction invalid.\n\nNo transaction in Bitcoin's history would have both hit the BIP54 sigop limit and been standard\naccording to today's Bitcoin Core policy[^0]. But what happened in the past doesn't matter as much\nas the fact that it is possible today to create a pathological standard transaction that is\nBIP54-invalid.\n\nThis opens up a major DoS vector against unupgraded miners if BIP54 ever gets activated in these\nconditions. Therefore i propose to make such transactions non-standard and hold off activation of\nBIP54 until we have good reasons to believe that the vast majority of the hashrate won't create a\nblock containing such a transaction.\n\nDoing so gives better guarantees in case BIP54 is ever considered for activation, and comes at\nvirtually no cost since these pathological transactions have never been used and serve no purpose\nbeyond increasing the cost of validation. Bitcoin Core PR #32521 implements this change, which i\nhope to get into the upcoming 30.0 release as well as backported to previous versions.\n\nBest,\nAntoine Poinsot\n\n[^0]: Here the full list of historical transactions that would have hit the BIP54 sigops limit:\n    - 659135664894e50040830edb516a76f704fd2be409ecd8d1ea9916c002ab28a2\n    - bea1c2b87fee95a203c5b5d9f3e5d0f472385c34cb5af02d0560aab973169683\n    - 24b16a13c972522241b65fbb83d09d4bc02ceb33487f41d1f2f620b047307179\n    - 53666009e036171b1aee099bc9cd3cb551969a53315410d13ad5390b8b4f3bd0\n    - ffc178be118bc2f9eaf016d1c942aec18441a6c5ec17c9d92d1da7962f0479f6\n    - 2f1654561297114e434c4aea5ca715e4e3f10be0be8c1c9db2b6f68ea76dae09\n    - 62fc8d091a7c597783981f00b889d72d24ad5e3e224dbe1c2a317aabef89217e\n    - d939315b180d3d73b5e316eb57a18f8137a3f5943aef21a811660d25f1080a3f\n   ",

It's not an attack \nin the sense of loss of funds\nfor a second-layers failing to include a time-sensitive tx, typically a \ncommiment tx. But if you're a participant\nin a multi-party flow and you're deliberately contributing a non standard \ninput to a collaborative tx, because\nyou know that the software of the collaborative tx finalizer won't verify \nand tx propagation will fail, what it\nis if it's not DoS attack, I don't know.\n\nOne has to put itself in the shoes of a LSP, for which liquidity to \nallocate is scarce (in a world where\n`MAX_MONEY` is true), and of which its propagation collaborative tx \nallocating liquidity is DoSed. E.g if you\ntake core-lightning, i think a software you're familiar with, it implements \nsuch standardness script sanitization\nduring the collaborative flow construction (in `common/interactivetx.c`):\n\n            /* BOLT #2:\n                         * The receiving node: ...\n                         * - MAY fail the negotiation if `script`\n                         *   is non-standard */\n                        if (!is_known_scripttype(scriptpubkey, \ntal_bytelen(scriptpubkey)))\n                                return tal_fmt(ctx, \"Script is not \nstandard\");\n\nFor the how to you sort trusted vs non-trusted participant in a \ncollaborative txn flow, on the image\nof a coinjoin or lightning dual-funding, it's not a solved problem. \nEspecially if the idea is to automate\nas much as you can of the protocol flow, without necessarily Bob the \nsysadmin manually clicking on each\n`tx_add_input` proposal from each multi-party tx participant to allow them \nin at 3AM in the morning...\n\nOf course Bob can be very successful in sorting standard vs non-standard \n",

Howewer, to my \nunderstanding, the proposal clearly lacks solid foundations, and although \nit tries to anticipate some objections, the responses offered are either \ninsufficient or even counterproductive.\n\n1) The issue of miner incentives is overstated\nThe last bitcoin won’t be mined until the year 2140, which means we’re \nstill more than 100 years away. Justifying such a structural change today \nbased on a concern that lies completely outside our current technical, \nsocial, and economic horizon is an exaggeration. As rewards decrease, \nBitcoin has already shown a natural tendency to substitute them with \ntransaction fees, without this causing any systemic collapse.\n\n2) Artificial scarcity is not a problem (it’s part of the design)\nBitcoin is divisible into 100 million satoshis per unit, which provides \nmore than enough granularity to operate even if BTC reaches astronomical \nvalues. If 1 BTC were worth more than 1 million u$s, each satoshi would be \nworth over a cent. If necessary, an extension of decimals could be \nconsidered in the future (as is already done in Lightning with \nmillisatoshis), without altering the fundamental rules.\n\nThe idea that “lost value must be recovered” to maintain liquidity \ncompletely ignores the fact that in a deflationary economy, the loss of \nunits doesn’t necessarily reduce system functionality—it increases the \nvalue of the remaining units. In the words of Satoshi Nakamoto himself:\n“Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of \nit as a donation to everyone.” (I clarify that i do not necessarily \nintended to be canonical)\n\n3) The confiscation risk doesn't disappear just because it's framed as \n\"reauthentication.\"\nThe argument that “if you can’t move your coins for 20 years, it’s \nindistinguish",

They \nhighlight important edge cases, particularly around long-term inheritance \nplanning and time-locked contracts, that deserve further discussion.\n\nThe intent of this proposal is not to seize anyone’s Bitcoin but to create \na rules-based mechanism for reintroducing truly abandoned coins—those \nlocked away forever due to lost keys—back into the economy. If a private \nkey is irrecoverably lost, the associated Bitcoin is effectively removed \nfrom circulation and, arguably, no longer owned. In such cases, the \nso-called \"security tax\" affects no active participant.\n\nThat said, your concerns are valid. One potential refinement would be to \nextend the inactivity window significantly—perhaps even to 100 years—to \nbetter accommodate multi-generational ownership and time-locked smart \ncontracts. The core idea is that a sufficiently long timeframe, paired with \nclear expectations and wallet alerts, can strike a balance between \npreserving ownership rights and sustaining economic viability.\n\nIt's also possible that this proposal—or one like it—may only be \nrealistically implemented as part of a broader hard fork in the distant \nfuture, potentially bundled with other critical changes such as \npost-quantum security upgrades.

People will keep losing keys. And one day, someone will lose the \nprivate key to the very last satoshi.

Tim Ruffing, Yannick\nSeurin and I recently published DahLIAS, the first interactive aggregate\nsignature scheme with constant-size signatures (64 bytes) compatible with\nsecp256k1.\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2025/692.pdf\n\nRecall that in an aggregate signature scheme, each signer contributes their own\nmessage, which distinguishes it from multi- and threshold signatures, where all\nsigners sign the same message. This makes aggregate signature schemes the\nnatural cryptographic primitive for cross-input signature aggregation because\neach transaction input typically requires signing a different message.\n\nPrevious candidates for constant-size aggregate signatures either:\n- Required cryptographic assumptions quite different from the discrete logarithm\n   problem on secp256k1 currently used in Bitcoin signatures (e.g., groups with\n   efficient pairings).\n- Were \"folklore\" constructions, lacking detailed descriptions and security\n   proofs.\n\nBesides presenting DahLIAS, the paper provides a proof that a class of these\nfolklore constructions are indeed secure if the signer does _not_ use key\ntweaking (e.g., no Taproot commitments or BIP 32 derivation). Moreover, we show\nthat there exists a concrete attack against a folklore aggregate signature\nscheme derived from MuSig2 when key tweaking is used.\n\nIn contrast, DahLIAS is proven to be compatible with key tweaking. Moreover, it\nrequires two rounds of communication for signing, where the first round can be\nrun before the messages to be signed are known. Verification of DahLIAS\nsignatures is asymptotically twice as fast as half-aggregate Schnorr signatures\nand as batch verification of individual Schnorr signatures.\n\nWe believe DahLIAS offers an attractive building block for a potential CISA\nproposal and welcome any feedback or discussion.\n\nJonas Nick, Tim Ruffing, Yannick Seurin\n\n\n[0] See, e.",

In particular, the \"single-b\"\nvariant with the larger signing cost doesn't appear to have advantages (see\nbelow) compared to \"multi-b\" which has lower signing cost.\n\n > The scheme is explicitly not limited to Bitcoin, nor blockchains, though,\n > so there's that; is that relevant here?\n\nThe scheme is not limited to Bitcoin, but the main application we designed for\nis Bitcoin. I agree that verification performance is of primary importance. We\nwould choose a scheme with lower signing performance, if it gives us a better\nverification performance in return (if the trade-off is reasonable).\n\n > Yes, those are some interesting points to consider.

Moreover, both R_{2,i} and R_{2,j} could have a valid proof\nof knowledge attached (for example, if parties i and j share the dlog of R_{2,i}\n= R_{2,j}).\n\n > Anyway, for me it was more a sort of preference for purely algebraic\n > algorithms.

Thus, \nrelease of consensus layer for RGB had required us to build its complete \nfunctionality, which is kind of ossified from the day of the release, with \na very small surface for possible future changes or upgrades.\n\nAnyway, here we are: finally the protocol is complete, with all required \nfunctionality (including support for zk-STARK compression) being present \nthere. Adding zk-STARK support was quite a challenge, which took most of \nthe last year, and required to re-think and re-do the virtual machine and \nthe full computing environment which was used by RGB.

AFAICT, the only reason we'd use WOTS+ over stock\n > WOTS (w/o randomizers) would be if we wanted to use a less\n > collision-resistant hash algo (RMD160) as the primary hash\n > function.\n\nWhen using RMD160 in WOTS+ instead of SHA256, you reduce the security level to\n80 bits. Roughly speaking, while WOTS+ relies only on preimage resistance,\nquantum computers get a quadratic speedup finding preimages due to Grover's\nalgorithm. A more detailed analysis of this is in [0] (see Theorem 2 and Table\n1).\n\n > Would OP_HASH160 (aka rmd160(sha256(...))) be a\n > possible contender for the hash function here, to shrink\n > the witness size further while still retaining some of the\n > collision resistance of SHA256?\n\nI'm probably missing something, but I don't see how this would work because you\ncan find a collision with about 2^80 queries.\n\n[0] https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1256.pdf (This should have been link [5] in the\n     previous email, sorry)\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/f7f72e13-eaa1-4837-9ba0-4b8d1eddf160%40gmail.com.",

P2QRH outputs commit directly to the tapleaf merkle root\ncomputed by taproot.\n\nThe scriptPubKey for a P2QRH output is:\n\nOP_PUSHNUM_3 OP_PUSHBYTES_32 <tapleaf merkle root>\n\nAdvantages of this approach\n\n\n   1.\n\n   We can reuse taproot code, but just skip taptweak steps.\n   2.\n\n   Everyone who understands P2TR, already understands P2QRH.\n   3.\n\n   By supporting tapscript and tapleaf, it supports everything that\n   supports tapscript.\n   4.\n\n   P2QRH protects tapscript outputs against long-exposure attacks. This is\n   a big win because long-exposure attacks will be practical before\n   short-exposure attacks. Note: protecting against short-exposure attacks\n   requires PQ signatures.\n   5.\n\n   P2QRH gives us similar functionality as the much discussed option of\n   disabling key-spends in P2TR on Q-Day (when quantum attacks become\n   practical), but with the added benefit that the ecosystem can upgrade well\n   before Q-Day. This removes the risks of attempting a consensus change\n   during an emergency or acting too late.\n\n\nWe moved PQ signatures specification out of BIP-360 so that P2QRH can be\ndebated independently of the debate over PQ signature algorithms. This\nallows us to move forward on P2QRH without forcin",
