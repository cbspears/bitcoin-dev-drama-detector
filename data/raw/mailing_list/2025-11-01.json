The need to commit each script pubkey to other prevouts in the TX would probably hold the concept back from being practical, especially for deterministic backup wallets which is likely the bulk of modern Bitcoin usage. I could imagine offline/hardware wallets having a very tough time with this.\n\nConsider a more conservative (but also very common) use case: Aggregating inputs controlled by the same owner. In this context, what the sender is really trying to prove here isn't whether UTXO A committed to UTXO B. For signature aggregation across commonly-owned inputs, they just need to be able to prove that UTXO A and UTXO B are spendable under the same pubkey, and that they, the pubkey owner, authorized both of them via a single signature.\n\nSo instead of committing a taptree to pre-existing UTXOs (which creates statefulness), you could commit a taptree to a deterministic set of pubkeys, such as \"the nearest 100 addresses in the same BIP32 account\". At spending time, we reveal the same pubkey's script leaf on all inputs, plus a signature that covers all the inputs. This would allow stateless address generation, while also allowing a single signature to cover all common inputs in a wallet.\n\nThis would have pretty bad effects on UTXO privacy, because the common-owner heuristic would become even stronger and would be provable on-chain, but OP_CIV would also likely have a similar effect on chain forensics. Maybe the fee savings would be worth it, esp for big exchanges which consolidate hundreds or thousands of UTXOs at a time.\n\n-conduition\nOn Saturday, November 1st, 2025 at 2:02 PM, Tadge Dryja <rx@awsomnet•org> wrote:\n\n> Hello-\n> \n\n> Here's an idea for Post-Quantum cross-input signature aggregation.

It's always trivial to get a 100% embedding rate if it's OK to assume \nthe embedder is choosing to share data off-blockchain with others (just xor \nthe real signature with their chosen data and call that the key). This is \nof course is a bit silly (though not entirely silly); if the purpose is to \n*communicate* then they can use the communication channel for the data, \ninstead of the xor value, and forget about the blockchain. On the other \nhand if their purpose is to publish data, and rely on the immutability and \npersistence of the blockchain, then there is the problem that the xor key \ncan be lost; it's that offchain data that represents the actual semantics \nof what they published, and so they're in rather the same position as they \nwould have been without the blockchain existing at all. (insert \nfinesses/caveats but, basically).\n\n2. All of the above theoretical analysis doesn't work for ECDSA *as an \nalgorithm outside of Bitcoin*. You get 32 bytes of embedding without \nleaking the private key, there. (the s-value can literally be made to say \n\"hello world\" 3 times or whatever). this is the non-pubkey-committing \nnature of standard ECDSA. I *think* you can make it behave the same as \nSchnorr in terms of pubkey-unembeddability-without-key-leakage by putting \nthe pubkey in the message, but it's even harder to analyze than Schnorr \n(which is already hard).\n\n3. In contrast to 2., the pubkey is in fact embedded in the message \n(indirectly), at least usually, in Bitcoin (except sighash_noinput type \nstuff which isn't live), so you can't put hello world in the signatures for \nnow, at least AFAIK. Still even then you're stuck at a 33% rate if we \ninclude all of P, R, s, which seems reasonable (in fact, that's a generous \nmeasure). Again, I am ignoring gr",

It introduces a \ndedicated, structured, full-fee data lane for on-chain data, without \ndisrupting existing transaction rules. Think of it like this - segOP is to \narbitrary data what SegWit was to signatures — a clean, isolated, \nforward-compatible path that preserves old-node harmony while restoring fee \nfairness.\n\nAbstract:\n\n    segOP defines a new segregated data section for Bitcoin transactions, \ncryptographically committed via OP_SUCCESS184. It standardizes on-chain \nmetadata storage by enforcing full fees, structured TLV encoding, and a 100 \nKB cap, while remaining backward-compatible with legacy nodes.\n\nIt is not:\n\n    - A replacement for OP_RETURN\n    - An off-chain mechanism\n    - A hard fork\n\nIt is:\n\n    - A soft-fork-safe, future-proof, SegWit-style data section\n    - Full-fee (4 weight units per byte)\n    - Structured (TLV + Merkle-root verified)\n    - Limited to 100 KB per transaction\n\nWhat issues could segOP rectify?:\n\n    1. Ordinals abuse witness discount. segOP will apply full fee rate for \nlarge data.\n    2. No structured metadata lane. segOP introduces TLV-encoded + \nMerkle-verified section.\n    3. Witness discount abused for megabytes. segOP Enforces 100 KB cap.\n    4. OP_RETURN unstructured & limited. segOP = structured + verifiable.\n    5. Spam cheap storage. segOP deters spam with fees.\n\n    In short - segOP restores fairness — data pays its real weight cost, \npreserving block space for financial use.\n\nWhere segOP lives:\n\n    Transaction Layout (Post-segOP)\n    Transaction\n    ├── nVersion\n    ├── vin (inputs)\n    ├── vout (o",

If it was cheaper than witness space,\nI think it would be a serious consideration especially for rollups.\nThe idea that the bytes incur full cost (4WU) makes it on arrival economically speaking.\n\nAlso it's a bit unclear how consensus and nodes in sync would interact with the \"recent window\".\n\nIt's a reasonable approach to mandate the presence of such an extension block near the chain-tip, but\nnodes by default should not download or verify it during IBD. This would only add a constant burden to nodes,\nwhile allowing bitcoin to scale on higher layers more that require such proof of publication mechanism for\ntheir security.\n\nThinking that this would be used by graffiti type payloads that especially are seeking the permanence, persistence\nand replication of bitcoin transactional data, or that metaprotocols that want to use the block space as an archival\nlayer for their own token ledgers is I'm afraid completely misguided or even delusional.\n\nBR,\nmoonsettler\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/3S1IMGSH6z-3Ho81Ugp9o-ltTwpIC-4ow6bn6aEAtK4XrkG5HTkvTw0BeZFpPILfabdp7rz_LDHEBWX_XZk0a7nKR4sJRUp_3B7pAMaJ86I%3D%40protonmail.com.",

Section 8 of the white paper also discusses honest\nnodes and which transactions are accepted into blocks.\n\nSatoshi further clarified standardness:\n\"The design supports a broad range of transaction types that are possible,\nbut not all are standard. Standard transactions are the ones that are\ndesigned to be used for the common case.\"\n-- June 2010\n\nPer Section 11, the white paper's security model shows honest miners (e.g.\nfollowing standard operation) outpacing alternatives. In practice, miners\nfollowing a standardness agreement or soft fork for OP_RETURN would, on\naffected blocks, earn around $100,000 more, than under a mixed policy,\nmaking prioritizing standard transactions the economically optimal strategy.\n\nThis is because there are a finite number of blocks before each halving, so\nthe opportunity cost of non-standard payloads is half the subsidy, which is\nmore than enough economic upside to offset fees. A standardness agreement\nsoft fork is therefore economically compelling for miners: it aligns with\nlong-standing practice and provides long-term incentives.\n\nBest,\nMelvin\n\n\n>\n> Bitcoin was specifically designed to prevent censorship of transactions\n> that follow the consensus rules.

Then, to clean it up, OP_2DROP would consume two\nelements, so that means 230 bytes, to clean it up with OP_2DROPs, and a\nsingle OP_DROP.\n\nI think it could be something like that:\n\nOP_TOALTSTACK <9660 bytes> OP_FROMALTSTACK OP_PICK OP_TOALTSTACK\n<OP_2DROP*229> OP_DROP\nOP_DUP OP_HASH160 OP_FROMALTSTACK OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\n\nAnd then, this is how it could be executed:\n\n<sig> <pubkey> <number>                    //input stack\n<sig> <pubkey>                             //toaltstack\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes>            //pushing hashes\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes> <number>   //pushing number\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes> <hash>     //picking hash\n<sig> <pubkey> <lots_of_hashes>            //toaltstack\n<sig> <pubkey>                             //dropping the rest\n<sig> <pubkey> <pubkey>                    //dup\n<sig> <pubkey> <hash>                      //hash160\n<sig> <pubkey> <hash> <hash>               //fromaltstack\n<sig> <pubkey>                             //equalverify\nOP_TRUE                                    //checksig\n\nWhich means, that it would take 9660 bytes, plus 230 bytes of dropping, so\nit sums up to 9890 bytes. Then, 9 bytes are consumed by the rest of the\nenvelope, and that leaves 101 bytes for signature and public key. Seems\ndoable. But I didn't check it in regtest yet.\n\npon., 20 paź 2025 o 18:48 Greg Maxwell <gmaxwell@gmail•com> napisał(a):\n\n> Perhaps it's also worth explicitly pointing out for people following at\n> home how this proposal has a very real confiscation risk:  bare\n> multisigs can easily violate the proposed limit-- if uncompressed points\n> are used an \"of 8\" policy is suffici",

The proposed tiny_count of 100 would split that particular image \nacross at least 19 Txs (likely a lot more if on-chain indexing were used), \nwhich only adds at least +6% to fees, but it does ruin \"atomicity\" (images \nall-in-one Tx) by adding complexity of needing some type of index to link \nthem, causes confirmation risk, & pushes data abusers toward OP_RETURN or \nwitness space.\n\nChanging the 100 tiny_count to 50 ≈ +11% fees; to 30 ≈ +16% fees; & to 20 ≈ \n+24% fees (this only takes into account an extra 200 bytes per additional \ninput Tx and does not consider any additional indexing needs) .

My main \nfrustrations with Lightning are the need for watchtowers, and routing \ncomplexities that arise from channel liquidity limitations. I wondered if \nwe could leverage the existing mining infrastructure instead of building \nseparate systems.\n\nMy goal was to find a scaling solution that:\n\n\n   - Eliminates watchtower requirements by using miners (who are already \n   always online)\n   - Avoids channel-based routing complexities\n   - Guarantees eventual settlement\n   - Creates natural economic incentives for all participants\n\nI'm not a Bitcoin developer, but I wanted to share this concept with the \ncommunity to see if others think it could work and how it might be \nimplemented. I'm particularly interested in feedback on the technical \nfeasibility.\n\nHere's the concept:\n\n*Anticipation Pool*\n\nAnticipation transactions (ATX) are pre-signed Bitcoin transactions that \nare forwardable to anyone without immediate blockchain settlement.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nInstead of publishing transactions to the mempool to add them to the \nblockchain, you create a pre-signed ATX that goes into a special pool \ncalled the anticipation pool, managed by miners. Once enough miners have \nvalidated your ATX and added it to the pool (validation threshold to be \ndetermined, e.g., 10-30% of hashpower depending on amount), the recipient \ncan consider it \"confirmed\". Double-spending is prevented because miners \ntimestamp and validate each forward, with first-seen winning, and check \nagainst the anticipation pool, mempool and blockchain to ensure the outputs \nhaven't been spent elsewhere.\n\nThe ATX has a timelock (e.g. 30 days), during this time only the recipient \ncan publish it to the mempool, forward it to someone else (including to \nthemselves), or split it to multiple people.

It contains extensive testing\nof each of the four proposed mitigations, and was used as a basis to generate test vectors for\nBIP54. I opened a PR against the BIPs repository to add them to BIP54 [1].\n\nThe test vectors for the transaction-level sigops limit contain a wide variety of usage combinations\nas well as ways of running into the limit. They also include some historical violations as well as\npathological transactions demonstrating the implementation details of the sigop accounting logic\n(which was itself borrowed from that of BIP16, which all Bitcoin implementations presumably already\nhave).\n\nThe test vectors for the new witness-stripped transaction size restriction similarly exercise the\nbounds of the check under various conditions (e.g. transactions with/without a witness). All\nhistorical violations were also added to the test vectors, thanks to Chris Stewart for digging those\nup.\n\nBecause the new timestamp restrictions are tailor-made to the mainnet difficulty adjustment\nparameters, the test vectors for those contain a number of chains of mainnet headers (from genesis).\nEach test case contains a full header chain and whether it is valid according to BIP54. These chains\nwere generated using a custom miner available in [2] and added to the implementation as a JSON data\nfile.\n\nThe test vectors for the coinbase restriction similarly include a chain of mainnet blocks, because\nthe timelock check is context-dependent.

          "body": "Hi Riard,\n\nThanks for the feedback. I understand your point as asking about other costs besides quadratic\nhashing, and how the BIP54 \"potentially executed\" sigop limit relates to those.\n\nThere are indeed several other expensive operations when validating a block: ECDSA signature\nverifications, FindAndDelete's vector modifications, and prevout lookups. This last one is related\nto the recently discussed limit on scriptPubKey sizes [0], as they present a constant factor\nincrease in the lookup cost that is not bounded by the size of the block being validated.\n\nIn any case the cost of these other expensive operations is completely dwarfed by quadratic hashing. The\nexample you give is unfortunately far from the worst case. I added you to the semi-private Delving\nthread [1] which contains the detail of the calculations for various DoS blocks. Feel free also to\nreach out to me in private, if you prefer email to Delving.\n\nFurthermore, exploiting the prevout lookup cost is highly uneconomical to a miner. It requires over\na hundred preparation blocks in order to create a single block that would take a couple dozens of\nseconds to validate on a modern machine. By comparison, without the BIP54 sigops limit this same\neffect can be achieved with 2 orders of magnitude less preparation blocks, making the attack viable\nfor a revenue-maximizing miner. Without the BIP54 sigops limit, over a hundred preparation blocks\nalso gets you a block that takes over 10 minutes to validate on a modern machine.\n\nFinally, besides having diminishing returns these mitigations would also have a higher confiscatory\nsurface [2]. The BIP54 mitigation was chosen because it pinpoints exactly the harmful behaviour we\nwant to prevent, with only a minimal impact on potentially legitimate usage [3], while making\nattacks of miners on their competition uneconomical as well as making the very worst case largely\nuninteresting to an externally-motivated attacker.\n\nBest,\nAntoine\n\n[0]: https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/O",

It has already been reported in\na GitHub [issue][0] and shared on social media. However, I wanted to\nformally disclose it on the mailing list so that all users are aware of the\nrisks. The full disclosure approach is primarily used when vulnerabilities\nare ignored. It is exactly what happened in this case although it has been\n[fixed][1] in bitcoin knots which also persists the history to disk.\n\nSome RPC commands use private keys, wallet passphrase etc. in their\narguments and this remained in the debug console history until [2016][2].\nAn attacker can no longer see the history and get sensitive information\nwith the history filter. However, [`migratewallet`][3] wasn't added in the\nhistory filter. This allows an attacker with access to the victim's machine\nto get the wallet passphrase from the history.

          "body": "Hello all!\n\n\tAs some of you know, I've been chipping away (with help now from\nJulian Moik, Cc'd) at a framework to restore bitcoin's scripting\nlanguage to its original power.  My approach has been to stick with\nScript: even if you prefer other approaches, you should find this\nrestoration and enhancement of script capabilities a useful comparison.\n\nCurrent drafts in \"review me!\" format:\n\n\thttps://github.com/rustyrussell/bips/pull/1\n\nHere is a brief description of each:\n\n1. Varops Budget For Script Runtime Constraint (bip-unknown-varops-budget.mediawiki)\n\nThis extends and generalizes the sigops budget into a \"variable\noperations\" budget, using benchmarks taken from the prototype\nimplementation across various machines.  This budget is per transaction,\nby weight, designed to constrain usage to ensure rapid evaluation\nwithout overly restricting scripting ability.\n\n2. Restoration of Script Capabilities\n\nOnce the safety net of the varops budget is in place, disabled opcodes\ncan be re-enabled, stack object size and total capacity extended, and\nabitrary-length arithmetic restored (though numbers are now always\nunsigned).\n\n3. OP_TX\n\nOnce script can handle large data once more, the problem of\nintrospection is signficantly simplified: we can simply have an opcode\nwhich pushes parts of the current transaction onto the stack.  The\nconcrete design proposed here is a fruitful area for debate and review.\n\n4. New Opcodes for Tapscript v2\n\nThe most speculative part of the series suggests some opcodes which\nwould allow more optimal use of Script: OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK,\nOP_SEGMENT, OP_BYTEREV, OP_ECPOINTADD, OP_INTERNALKEY and OP_MULTI.\nSome of these are old friends, and others may be new to you: I look\nforward to your feedback.\n\nThere is also a prototype implementation we used for testing:\n\n\thttps://github.com/jmoik/bitcoin/tree/gsr\n\nThankyou in advance for your consideration!\nRusty & Julian.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Develop",

The main difference is that all integers are now\nunsigned: the combination of variable length and sign bit was a\nside-effect of the SSL bignum representation and has proven awkward to\ndeal with.\n\n    A word on the example implementation which was used to benchmark: it\ntreats numerical stack objects 64 bits at a time, but does not go so far\nas using assembly code.  It also had to implement a proper stack class,\nbecause the time to enforce the new \"total stack size limit\" naively was\nmeasurable.

QSAVE preserves 100% of the principal for rightful owners while using generated returns to fund the protocol and global public good. It provides an alternative to the QRAMP (Quantum Resistant Asset Migration Protocol) proposal (which makes coins unspendable) or taking no action (which allows quantum appropriation, which many view as theft). This proposal addresses coins that are dormant but acknowledges there may be coins that have quantum watermarks but have not migrated to quantum addresses. A separate BIP proposal will address this case.\n\nMotivation\n\nChain analysis reveals 3.5-5.5 million Bitcoin (~17-28% of circulating supply) have exposed public keys vulnerable to quantum attack (see Appendix: Quantum Vulnerability Assessment for detailed breakdown).\n\nWith sufficient education and proactive migration, a significant portion of the 2-4M BTC in reused addresses could be moved to quantum-safe addresses before the threat materializes. Modern wallets are increasingly implementing best practices such as always sending change to fresh addresses. However,",

He's saying the community can come to consensus on a new hash algo and then nodes continue operating under the same decentralized PoW protocol from then onwards, just with a slightly cryptographic primitive underlying it.\n\nHe is most definitely not saying the community should vest the power to mint new blocks in some trusted block-producing organization. That would be more closely analogous to what QSAVE is proposing, and would likewise be a total reversal of the principles that Bitcoin was founded on.\n\n\nUnfortunately, a consensus hash algorithm switcheroo is much easier to engineer than migrating the UTXO set to a new PQ secure signing primitive, because with UTXOs we're talking about an authentication (ownership) problem, rather than a coordination (consensus) problem. As you know, the network can't just hot-swap signing algorithms for old UTXOs the same way we can hot-swap hash algorithms for new blocks.\n\n\nFor the curious, here is the original thread where Satoshi said these things. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=191.0\n\n\n\nregards,\nconduition\nOn Friday, September 5th, 2025 at 9:45 AM, 'James T' via Bitcoin Development Mailing List <bitcoindev@googlegroups.com> wrote:\n\n> If we are going to quote Satoshi, he imagined that some group of people—the consensus—could come together and agree on what the chain should say if the underlying maths failed. “If SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we could come to some agreement about what the honest blockchain was before the trouble started, lock that in, and continue from there with a new hash function.”\n> \n\n> This is exactly what I am proposing; that we come to some agreement about what the honest blockcha",

It turns quantum security into a private incentive: fail to\nupgrade and you will certainly lose access to your funds, creating a\ncertainty where none previously existed.\n\n   -\n\n   Phase A: Disallows sending of any funds to quantum-vulnerable addresses,\n   hastening the adoption of P2QRH address types.\n   -\n\n   Phase B: Renders ECDSA/Schnorr spends invalid, preventing all spending\n   of funds in quantum-vulnerable UTXOs. This is triggered by a\n   well-publicized flag-day roughly five years after activation.\n   -\n\n   Phase C (optional): Pending further research and demand, a separate BIP\n   proposing a fork to allow recovery of legacy UTXOs through ZK proof of\n   possession of BIP-39 seed phrase.\n\nMotivation\n\nWe seek to secure the value of the UTXO set and minimize incentives for\nquantum attacks.

Together, they address the absence \nof an interoperable, canonical, secure format for wallet backups and \ntransfers.\n\n*1. Standard Encrypted Wallet Payload*\nA CBOR based format for serialising wallet data — including \ndescriptor-based accounts, optional transactions/UTXOs, metadata, and root \nsecrets. It cleanly separates the core data structure from its \ncryptographic protection, with encryption mandated via a companion \nstandard. This builds on BIPs 329, 380, 388, and 389, emphasising \nextensibility and deterministic encoding to enable reliable restores across \nwallets.\nThe draft BIP can be found here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/KeysSoze/7109a7f0455897b1930f851bde6337e3\n\n\n*2. Standard Wallet Encryption Envelope*\nA secure, versioned container for encrypting the payload using a password \nderived key with Argon2id, with scope for future extensions such as \nasymmetric encryption. It aims to provide robust protection while keeping \nthe format modular and library-agnostic.\nThe draft BIP can be found here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/KeysSoze/866d009ccd082edf6802df240154b20d\n\n\nBoth drafts are at a very early stage.

When attackers gain access to\n> private keys, they can drain wallets with varying degrees of difficulty but\n> ultimately succeed. Current security measures are visible and can be\n> circumvented by sophisticated attackers.\n>\n> This proposal creates an optional but irrevocable security mechanism where:\n>\n> # Wallet owners can voluntarily and irrevocably restrict future\n> transactions to predefined destination addresses\n> # Once activated, unauthorized transfer attempts are automatically\n> redirected to ar",

This allows wallets to derive codex32 \nbackups from BIP-0032 master keys.\n\n*Summary* \n\n   - \n   \n   Application number: 93'\n   - Derivation path: \n   m/83696968'/93'/{hrp}'/{threshold}'/{n}'/{byte_length}'/{id0}'/{id1}'/{id2}'/{id3}'/{index}' \n   \nCodex32, defined in BIP-93, is a human-readable encoding with checksumming \nand share indexing designed for SSS backups of BIP-0032 seeds. This PR \nproposes a deterministic way to generate codex32 strings using BIP-85.\n\n*Rationale* \n\n   - \n   \n   Mirrors the existing BIP-85 application for BIP-39.\n   - \n   \n   Codex32 offers error correction, hand verification, identifiers, and \n   secret sharing features compared to BIP-39.\n   - \n   \n   Adds a standardized way for wallets to generate codex32 backups from \n   BIP-85-derived entropy\n   - \n   \n   Test vectors and reference implementation are linked to in the PR.\n   \n*Risks and alternatives* \n\n   - \n   \n   Wallet adoption of codex32 is still limited, though a draft PR #32652 \n   <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32652?utm_source=chatgpt.com> \n   for importing codex32 strings to Bitcoin Core has support.\n   - Codex32 implementers could use the BIP-85 dice application, but \n   defining a direct application improves interoperability.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/compare/master...BenWestgate:bips:codex32 \n<https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/compare/master...BenWestgate:bips:codex32?utm_source=chatgpt.com>\n\nFeedback is welcome.\nBest regards,\nBen Westgate\n\n-- \nYou received this message bec",
