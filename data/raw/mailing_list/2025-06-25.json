In this case the only thing an attacker \nneeds is to acquire 2 BTC. They would also earn fees from coinjoin being a \nmaker.\n\nIndeed hedging is something to consider when analyzing cost of timelocking \ncoins. It's not obvious what its effect is, but it certainly doesn't remove \nthe \"opportunity cost\"/\"sacrifice\" (i.e. the cost derived from the time \nvalue of money), and thus doesn't invalidate the idea of using a timelock \nto create a nontrivial cost to attack the system. What it does it remove \none aspect of cost, which comes from the volatility in the \"true value\" \n(however you want to measure that, e.g. purchasing power) of the asset \n(here, 1 BTC), but with the additional cost of locking more capital (and \ntransaction costs, and ..). But with or without hedging, the *main* aspect \nof cost remains: you forego the opportunity to use those funds otherwise, \nduring the locked period; the monetary value of that opportunity cost is a \nlot less than the 1 BTC, of course, for only 3 months, but it is a lot \ngreater than zero.\n\nOn to calculating costs:\n\nIn this other part of my reply, I wrote:\n\n> Just a pure \"I own a utxo\" imposes no, or negligible cost. As per the \ndelving post, and in a few other places, I've noted you can impose an age \nand value restriction to bump up the cost.\n\nSo your idea of calculating that is certainly something I considered, \nthough, how exactly one constructs the right kind of formula isn't that \nobvious. I had something like age^a * value ^ b whereas you are looking at \nstraight multiplication in your linked gitlab note  (so I guess a=1, b=1) \n(also you weight by utxo type, but I guess that's a very small delta).

          "body": "Hi All,\n\nRecently someone pointed out that BIP 380 specifies that `H` can be used \nas a hardened indicator in derivation paths, in addition to `'` and `h`. \nHowever, there was also a test which suggested that `H` was not a valid \nhardened indicator. A PR resolving this discrepancy by moving that test \nfrom the invalid to the valid section was merged, but there is still a \nquestion of whether this was the right course of action.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin Core does not implement this, and AFAICT, neither \ndoes rust-miniscript. There is an open PR to Bitcoin Core to allow `H` \n(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32788), but ongoing discussion \nsuggests that perhaps the BIP should be modified instead as it seems \nprobable that no implementation of descriptors allows `H`.\n\nSo the question is: are there any implementations of descriptors that \nemit descriptors that use `H` as a hardened indicator, or permit `H` as \na hardened indicator?\n\nI think the former question is more useful to know as it is more \nimportant that the descriptor implementations can parse each other's \nproducts. It is possible that there are implementations that allow `H` \nbut do not emit `H`, since there are libraries that provide BIP 32 \nutilities which allow `H`.\n\nThanks\nAva\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/848d3d4b-94a5-4e7c-b178-62cf5015b65f%40achow101.com.",

Schoolbook Winternitz\none-time signatures, forest-of-trees few-time signatures, and Merkle trees\nall validate signatures (/authentication paths) by recomputing the public\nkey (/Merkle tree root) from the signature and the message, and checking\nwhether the recomputed public key matches the actual public key. That means\nwe can pick anything for the signature, and just set the public key to the\nrecomputed public key.\n\nThe situation is more subtle for actual standardized hash-based signatures.\nRFC 8391 XMSS doesn’t sign the message itself, but first hashes in (among\nothers) the public key. Basically the best we can do for XMSS (except for\nsetting the signature randomizer) is to guess the public key. Thus it’s\npretty much jpeg resistant.\n\nThe situation is different again for RFC 8391 XMSSMT. XMSSMT is basically a\ncertificate chain of XMSS signatures. An XMSSMT public key is an XMSS\npublic key. An XMSSMT signature is a chain of XMSS signatures: the XMSSMT\npublic key signs another XMSS public key; which signs another public XMSS\npublic key; …; which signs the message. Again the top XMSSMT public key is\nhashed into the message signed, but that only binds the first XMSS\nsignature. We can’t mess with the first signature, but the other signatures\nwe can choose freely, as those roots are not bound. Thus XMSSMT with two\nsubtrees is only half jpeg resistant and it gets worse with more subtrees.\n\nSimilarly SLH-DSA (FIPS 205, née SPHINCS+) is a certificate chain of (a\nvariant of) XMSS signing another XMSS public key, which si",

This makes aggregate signature schemes the\nnatural cryptographic primitive for cross-input signature aggregation because\neach transaction input typically requires signing a different message.\n\nPrevious candidates for constant-size aggregate signatures either:\n- Required cryptographic assumptions quite different from the discrete logarithm\n   problem on secp256k1 currently used in Bitcoin signatures (e.g., groups with\n   efficient pairings).\n- Were \"folklore\" constructions, lacking detailed descriptions and security\n   proofs.\n\nBesides presenting DahLIAS, the paper provides a proof that a class of these\nfolklore constructions are indeed secure if the signer does _not_ use key\ntweaking (e.g., no Taproot commitments or BIP 32 derivation). Moreover, we show\nthat there exists a concrete attack against a folklore aggregate signature\nscheme derived from MuSig2 when key tweaking is used.\n\nIn contrast, DahLIAS is proven to be compatible with key tweaking.

Verification of DahLIAS\nsignatures is asymptotically twice as fast as half-aggregate Schnorr signatures\nand as batch verification of individual Schnorr signatures.\n\nWe believe DahLIAS offers an attractive building block for a potential CISA\nproposal and welcome any feedback or discussion.\n\nJonas Nick, Tim Ruffing, Yannick Seurin\n\n\n[0] See, e.",

I find myself stepping back through the arguments for this structure R1 \n+ bR2 in MuSig2.

The \nverification now allows for multiple pubkeys and messages to be inputs; \nthat's the whole point, we're publically verifying authorization of a bunch \nof (pubkey, message) pairs, so it would be incoherent or at least \nunnecessary to *require* some kind of aggregate pubkey as input.

This can result in perceived \n\"disappearance\" or \"freezing\" of funds, and is especially problematic for \nprivacy-focused or air-gapped users who do not maintain full mempool logs.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal**\n\nI propose a new opt-in mechanism called the *Self-Verifiable Transaction \nBroadcast Log*. When enabled, this feature would:\n\n- Record any transaction that a node accepts for broadcast (via P2P or \nRPC), along with a timestamp and source;\n- Optionally allow filtering by address or wallet;\n- Provide a new RPC call (e.g., `getbroadcastedtxs`) to retrieve this \ninformation;\n- Help users and wallets verify that a transaction existed — even if it was \nlater dropped, reorganized, or not confirmed.\n\nThis does not change any consensus behavior, and the log can be locally \nmanaged and purged by the user. It is purely a UX and auditability \nimprovement, similar in spirit to how `debug.log` can assist with debugging \nbut more structured and purpose-built.\n\n---\n\n**Motivation and Urgency**\n\nThis proposal stems from a real personal experience: having a valid signed \ntransaction broadcast via a node, but later be",

That's most unfortunate. While this is getting silly, I can't \nhelp wondering what happens, in the presence of an ECDLP breaker, to a \nbotched version of taproot that requires script-path spending and doesn't \nallow key-path.\n\nIt's interesting, imagine: honest keyholder creates Q = P_N + H(P_N||S)G \nwhere P_N means NUMS internal key. ECDLP breaker can just find DL of Q but \nif we disallow key-path spend they have to open a hash commitment to a \ntweak as per usual taproot rules.\n\nSo they need: Q = P_2 +H(P_2||S_2)G now, they know the full private key x_N \n+ H(P_N||S) for Q (and they may or may not know S, or be able to guess it, \nto get all the variables in that expression), but it seems to not help them \ngiven the commitment to P_2 in the hash, requiring them to choose P_2 \nbefore the hash.\n\nThey could of course do it with P_N itself, if that were allowed, hence the \n\"disable NUMS\" might make sense, in this scenario. Can't say I'm 100% sure \nof myself here, but it looks like that works.\n\nEven if I'm right, it's not so interesting; we already are assuming that a \nquantum attacker can't break hashes, that's behind a lot of the discussion \nhere, so of course it would make sense if we broke taproot to require it \nonly to use hashes (script path only), then it might come back to the same \nsecurity situation (which of course, is not actual security, since keys are \nalways revealed in spending).

The EC signature signs\n> the second transaction, which depends on the QR output's txid, which\n> in turn depends on the precommitted EC signature.\n\nSorry, my wording was vague in my last message. I was picturing an\narbitrary EC signature, possibly on a static message,\ne.g. sign(\"i was here first!\", sk). Not an EC signature on the\nreveal transaction, because you're right - that would be a cyclical\ndependency.\n\nI was thinking we commit to sha256(sign(static_msg, sk)) using a\nquantum-protected address in the commitment stage. In the reveal\ntransaction, we open the commitment by revealing \n\nsign(static_msg, sk), spending both the QR and EC UTXOs.\n\nHowever, I like your idea of committing to the pubkey instead of a\nsignature - it's simpler. As you said, we can't give the QC attacker\nopportunities to steal and so the commitment must be hidden until it\nis revealed when it comes time to spend the EC output. This applies\nto any kind of commit/reveal scheme, whether we use signatures or\npubkeys.\n\nThe exact mechanics will depend on what commitment mechanisms are\navailable to users of the hypothetical quantum-resistant script pubkey.\nBest case is we hope to have a taproot-like tweaking mechanism that\nlets us hide a commitment in the QR output script, or we use a P2SH\nwrapping layer around a hypothetical quantum-resistant checksig\nopcode, and hide the committed data in an inscription-like envelope\nwhich is opened by the reveal transaction.\n\n\nFor better scaling, we probably want to commit some kind of\naccumulator, rather than just a single raw hash. Otherwise you'd\nneed one QR UTXO to spend every locked EC UTXO, which isn't very\nefficient. For instance, say you have 10 locked EC utxos you want\nto rescue using a single QR output. You create a new QR output\nwhich hides a commitment to sha256(pk0, pk1, ...pk9) (or a merkle\ntree root of same). This way, a single QR ",

This standardness rule falls into the third category: it aims to mildly deter data storage while still allowing a less harmful alternative than using non-provably-unspendable outputs.\n\nDevelopers are now designing constructions that work around these limitations. An example is Clementine, the recently-announced Citrea bridge, which uses unspendable Taproot outputs to store data in its \"WatchtowerChallenge\" transaction due to the standardness restrictions on the size of OP_RETURNs[^0]. Meanwhile, we have witnessed in recent years that the nudge is ineffective to deter storing data onchain.\n\nSince the restrictions on the usage of OP_RETURN outputs encourage harmful practices while being ineffective in deterring unwanted usage, i propose to drop them. I suggest to start by lifting the restriction on the size of the scriptPubKey for OP_RETURN outputs, as a first minimal step to stop encouraging harmful behaviour, and to then proceed to lift the restriction on the number of OP_RETURN outputs per transactions.\n\nAntoine Poinsot\n\n[^0]: See section 6.1 of their whitepaper here https://citrea.xyz/clementine_whitepaper.pdf\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/rhfyCHr4RfaEalbfGejVdolYCVWIyf84PT2062DQbs5-eU8BPYty5sGyvI3hKeRZQtVC7rn_ugjUWFnWCymz9e9Chbn7FjWJePllFhZRKYk%3D%40protonmail.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #2: Type: text/html, Size: 3508 bytes --]",

I realize that you don’t know me, and I can only say that my position is also established with the same intentions.  With that said, I don’t think these types of services are a threat at all.  I think they are essential to a healthy mining network where miners can have some control over a portion of their future revenue streams, especially in the greatly reduced subsidy era we are about to enter.  And, I think the lack of a futures/forward market for blockspace is a major inhibitor to adoption and usage.  Its hard to build a business where access to block space is a necessity without any visibility to the future.  I believe this can be done in a manner that provides openness and transparency, and it would also give us for the first time visibility to future demand and pricing and I think that will be valuable to the enter ecosystem.

Whether I would be considered major or not can be judged by others.\n\nThat said, I suggest being very careful about projecting the current behavior of major miners as the norm or representative of the future.  We are extremely early in the development of the mining industry and there is a high likelihood that over the next few years that there will a dramatic change in the list of major miners – and there very well may be changes in the philosophies and priorities of these miners as well.\n\nI spent most of career in the personal computer industry going back to ’86 (most notably as the CTO of Gateway) and I learned many things from my experience.  One important thing was that the pace with which companies could rise to or fall from prominence was jaw-dropping.  Assuming that “major miners” was meant to mean a group that largely is comprised of pubcos, none of the major players in the mining industry have been doing it for long - with most going public very recently (’22 and ’23).   They but pups as companies and we’ve already seen a huge flameout or two.  The next three to five years will likely result in a few more flameouts and some large new entrants that may approach mining from a completely different perspective.  A second learning I will share from my PC development days was that predicting usages and user behavior is next to impossible.  The safest and most accommodating path is to give as much user optionality/configurability as possible.  My high-level recommendation is to work on paths that give users more choice not less.  This is applies to OP_RETURN but, even more importantly, I think it is the best design direction in general.\n\nTo offer what may be a new lens in which to view miners, I’ll share a bit of my philosophy and vision for my company.

One of those shortcomings was the difficulty reset creating havoc. [0] In spite of this a similar rule was adopted for testnet4. [1] As a result, testnet4 is similarly creating havoc. [2]\n\nThe goal of testnet is to mimic the Bitcoin mainnet. This is why it is useful to have in addition to a more control testing environment such as Signet.\n\nThe given rationale for a difficulty reset was to let developers occasionally mine blocks on their laptop. But you cannot have your cake and eat it too: either the network is permissionless (PoW) or you assign identities and privileges to some (Signet). By trying to do both at the same time testnet4 created a loophole for abuse. As a result it failed on both count: it neither mimics mainnet nor allows developers to mine active blocks on their laptop.\n\nI propose to fix this by removing the difficulty reset rule from testnet4 through a flag day hard fork on 2026-01-01. I picked a date well in the future to minimize disruption. This leaves enough time for a patch to be reviewed, merged, included in the next major Bitcoin Core release, backported to previous releases and adopted by the infrastructure running on testnet4. That should be enough for a test network.\n\nLet me know what you think,\nAntoine\n\n[0] https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CADL_X_eXjbRFROuJU0b336vPVy5Q2RJvhcx64NSNPH-3fDCUfw@mail.gmail.com\n[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0094.mediawiki#rule-specification\n[2] [https://fork.observer](https://fork.observer/) - pick the network on the top right corner\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/hU75",

I was thinking about just hacking at the UTXO set as it\nconceptually seemed to make the change very localized, but timelocks\nprobably(?) rule the whole approach out.\n\nThe freely-spendable amount would be:\n\namount/2^(targetHeight/halvingBlocks-utxoHeight/halvingBlocks)\n\nOr the bitshift equivalent, where targetHeight is the current height,\nor in the case of timelocks, the locked height, but longer\ntimestamp-based timelocks can't be reasoned about very well with any\n'degrading coin' behaviour, and even your presigned, height locked\ntransaction might not get be confirmed before the next epoch if the\ntimelock approaches it.\n\nDoesn't modifying spendability have the same problem? When presigning\nyour timelocked transaction, you need to be aware of the amount you can\nactually spend come expiry of the timelock up-front, however the coin\ndegrades.\n\nIt also breaks lightning channels, I think.\n\nOn Mon, 12 May 2025 18:18:09 +0000 (UTC)\nSaint Wenhao <saintwenhao@gmail•com> wrote:\n\n> > Updating the entire UTXO set all at once would be pretty expensive,\n> \n> Not only that.
