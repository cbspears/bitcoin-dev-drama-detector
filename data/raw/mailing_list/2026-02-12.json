          "body": "[-- Attachment #1: Type: text/plain, Size: 2771 bytes --]\n\nHi all,\n\nDuring discussion around BIP392 [1] for Silent Payment Output Script\nDescriptors, it emerged that due to the resource-intensive scanning\nrequirements of the protocol some metadata (for example the birthday block\nheight) may be practically required for efficient recovery of wallet funds.\nHowever, this metadata is not technically required to determine the output\nscripts, and therefore deemed unsuitable for direct inclusion in an output\ndescriptor. This may lead to a situation in future where a wallet backup\nconsisting of a valid output descriptor may not practically be complete\nenough to recover all the funds in a wallet.\n\nThis is not unique to silent payments. Any descriptor-based backup can\nsuffer from the same issue: the descriptor specifies in general what to\nderive, but not where to begin or how far to scan. A wallet restored with\nonly a descriptor must guess at parameters like the gap limit or starting\nblock height, and may be inefficient or alternatively miss funds if those\nguesses are too conservative.\n\nThis BIP proposal provides a solution in the form of annotations -\nkey/value pairs appended to a descriptor expression using URL-like query\nstring delimiters. Annotations provide a compact way to include such\nmetadata directly in a descriptor string, using characters already present\nin the BIP380 checksum character set.\n\nAn annotated descriptor has the form:\nSCRIPT?key=value&key=value#CHECKSUM\n\nThree key names are defined for starting block height, gap limit (for BIP32\nHD wallets) and max label index (for silent payments wallets). Annotation\nvalues are declared lower bounds: they represent the minimum values\nrequired to recover all funds at the time the descriptor was exported. Over\nthe lifetime of a wallet these values may increase (e.g. the gap limit may\ngrow as more addresses are used) but should not decrease.\n\nExample: wpkh([deadbeef/84h/0h/0h]xpub.../0/*)?bh=800000&gl=30#v35n46d2\n\nNote tha",

Biggest\nchanges from the latest release has been mostly working on compact-block\nBIP152 support, of\nwhich most of the groundwork is present, outbound tx synchronization and a\nlot of internal\ncircuitry due to the native multi-process architecture (and some other\nminors on addr mngt).\n\nCurrently, bitcoin backbone is leveraging a homemade C interface to deal\nwith the deeper\nlibbitcoinkernel encapsulated consensus code. Idea is of course to update\nthe consensus\ncode to the newer version, though for now in terms of flexibility using a\nhomemade interface\nhas a lot of advantages.\n\nI had a look on the libbitcoinkernel as you're finding in v0.30. I have no\nstrong opinion\non yet on the level of granularity around the btck_ChainstateManager\nabstraction. So far,\nbeing able to access lower levels is very useful, most notably for\ndebugging and checking\nthe internal state of your chain state manager, and knowing on which branch\nit is.\n\nYet, already coming to my mind, I'm thinking there are 2 interface\nextensions that could\nbe useful, or at least worthy to consider. The first one is 1) being able\nto verify header\nconsensus structure on their own. In bitcoin backbone, I have a\nblock-daemon managing block\nrelay and sanitizing the headers as they're coming it's useful (the\nlibbitcoinkernel would\nbe re-linked in the binary, but not stateful).\n\nA second extension would be able to validate a transaction in its wholeness\nfor all consensus checks\nduring mempool processing. Same backbone has its own mempool process (i.e\nmempool-daemon).\nI'm leaving for design broodings if it's interesting to be able to confirm\natomically a chain of unconfirmed\ntxn back to their origin coinbase or deeply buried UTXO.\n\nStill very much a toy, though at least it starts to have its own testing\nframework.\n\nKeep building.\n\nCheers,\nAntoine\nOTS hash: e2d9f01c29",

          "body": "Hi,\n\nThanks for your careful review of our BIP.\n\nThere still appears to be some confusion around the rationale for also constraining the nSequence,\nwhich suggests the explanation needs to be clearer. I’ve noted this in my collected feedback for the\nBIP [0] and will restate the rationale in more detail below.\n\nThe purpose of constraining the nSequence of coinbase transactions is to ensure that timelock\nvalidation is performed. An nSequence set as final (i.e. equal to 0xffffffff) allows timelock\nvalidation to be bypassed. Enforcing timelock validation gives us a context-independent guarantee\nwhen validating a block that no past block in the chain could possibly have had the same pair of\nnLockTime and nSequence. Therefore, assuming SHA256 isn’t broken, the txid of the coinbase\ntransaction in the block being validated is guaranteed to be unique.\n\nOf course, we already know that no block pre-BIP 34 activation had its nLockTime set in the\nhistorical chain [2]. However, being able to state that post-BIP 54 activation no coinbase\ntransaction can possibly be a duplicate is a useful reduction in complexity. For instance, if BIP 54\nactivation height ever gets buried in Bitcoin Core, the BIP 30 check could just be disabled past\nthis height instead of having to figure out if we are on a chain that contains the historical BIP 34\nactivation block hash [3].\n\nHopefully this clarifies the rationale. I’ll now respond to some specific points from your email.\n\n> With BIP 30, there is now a check at block validation to reject as invalid any\n> block posterior to the BIP activation cutoff (March 15, 2012, 00:00 UTC) [0].\n\nTechnically, as per the code you point to, BIP 30 is enforced from genesis in Bitcoin Core with the\nexception of the specific blocks at height 91,842 and 91,880 in the historical chain.\n\n> the only implicit mentioning I'm seeing of this problem, is here [3], it doesn't seem it has been\n> very peer reviewed, less even said to be documented in the BIP rational or the implem",

If I'm understanding correctly Luke's concern,\ncurrently the coinbase's scriptSig is used to store an extranonce. One\nhas to observe first there is no consensus limit on the size of a\ntransaction, which holds for the coinbase tx too, a fortiori there is\nno limit on the extranonce size a miner could fit in the scriptSig.\n\nThe point being made is that the nLocktime field of the coinbase\ntransaction could be used as a more efficient extra nonce due to\nthe positional location of nLocktime in a serialized coinbase being\none of the latest message block to be processed [0].\n\nNothing prevent a miner in already doing this and draw a speed advantage\nfrom the diminished computational work. I have not looked into CGminer code\nor one of its derivative forks, if there is an implemented option to do \nthat,\nbut yes there could be non-published existing mining firmware doing it. \nIIUC,\nBIP54 would nullify this theoretical \"speed advantage\" for all miners.\n\nNow, there could be an argument ecosystem-wise to let the nLocktime free,\nas who say speed advantage say less energy consumed network-wide (-- but\nisn't that a better outcome to maximize the energy burnt network-wide, even\nif it's probabilistic ?).\n\nOne alternative design would be to store the height commitment in the\ncommitment extension introduced by BIP141 [1]. In my understanding, as\nit has been pointed out by other minds in the design process about the\nactual proposal to put the height commitment in the nLocktime field, \nin the eventuality of more than 1 commitment being introduced, a naive\ndesign would come with the burden for non-upgraded nodes to have data\navailability to all the merkle path to validate a specific soft-forked\ncommitment. So a node could not just implement consensus validation rules\nfor SF #2, without getting the merkle tree data for SF #1.\n\nIt doesn't sound that this concern could be alleviated by making the",

This effectively limits the number of per-group recipients \nwithin a single transaction, i.e. the number of recipients sharing the same \nscan public key.

Signature aggregation relies\non a linear homomorphic algebraic structure that is inherent to Schnorr\nsignatures, and it’s precisely this property that enables constructions\nlike MuSig. Unfortunately, this kind of structure is not something we\nget across the post-quantum signature landscape (whether standardized\nor exotic schemes).\n\nL2 ZK rollups can mitigate this by verifying many user signatures off-\nchain and proving the resulting state transition with a single succinct\nproof, effectively collapsing many verifications into one on L1. In a\npost-quantum setting, LaBRADOR\n([https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1341.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1341.pdf)\n), a lattice-based SNARK could be adopted. Bitcoin-oriented ZK rollups\nalong these lines, such as Citrea, already explore this approach.\n\nMy current view is that L2 ZK constructions may be a key part of the\ntoolbox to mitigate the absence of aggregation and efficient batching —\nat least until we discover a PQ signature scheme with Schnorr-like\nadvantages. Considering it took roughly 30 years from RSA to reach\nSchnorr, we should expect that fully realizing such a post-quantum\nanalogue will likely take several years of research and development.\n\nVery happy to hear your thoughts on this, and thanks again for raising\nthe point. I’m still relatively new to Bitcoin, so if I’ve made any\nincorrect assumptions here, please feel free to correct me.\n\nBest regards,\nGiulio\n\nOn Thu, 2026-01-22 at 04:48 -0800, waxwing/ AdamISZ wrote:\n> Thanks for the report!\n> \n> Forgive the rather ignorant question here, but:\n> \n> Given the obvious that we have a problem with size on-chain (and I'm\n> awa",

Both you and Sipa \n(who also stated in that thread \"The problem is that people may see this as \na legitimation of the storage in the first place, and encourage doing so \neven more.\") seemed to be primarily motivated by the social signals that \nwould be sent by allowing even a small amount of data to be used \narbitrarily in the protocol, but felt (from my reading) that it may be \nworth the trade-off for, as you said, shaping users to more conservative \nneeds.\n\nI certainly appreciate your larger point here, where you state that current \nuse has nullified previously effective means of curbing this behavior, and \nas you say, sometimes even further increasing it. This is precisely why my \nproposal exists as it does. It acknowledges that these attempts to \"stop\" \nthe behavior are not effective against strong financial incentives to \novercome them.

So the spend likely needs to carry an SPV-style inclusion proof for the commit (txid + merkle branch to a block header + ≥K depth rule).\n\nA critical UX point is **fee sponsorship**: a receiver/exchange/service can publish the commit tx and pay fees, while the legacy holder authorizes the commitment off-chain (signature over the commitment hash), avoiding the “I can’t safely fee-pay Phase 1” problem.\n\nShort design note + diagram (please replace with your links):\n- Markdown:\nhttps://github.com/bnavf/bitcoinqp/blob/main/two_phase_destination_commitment.md\n- Diagram:\nhttps://github.com/bnavf/bitcoinqp/blob/main/two_phase_destination_commitment.svg\nQuestions for the list:\n1) Is there an existing proposal that already captures this “quarantine-mode legacy spends” framing?\n2) What’s the most reasonable way to do commitment inclusion/maturity pro",

We \nbelieve our experience dealing with the signature size overhead in a live \nproduction environment could provide a useful reference point.\n\nBest regards,\n\nEl sábado, 20 de diciembre de 2025 a las 8:04:18 UTC-4, Erik Aronesty \nescribió:\n\n> this scheme has no mitm attack or replay attack because of the use of \n> covenants to secure each step in the chain\n>\n> The best part about starting with something like this is that we can have \n> a safe quantum vault, too useful covenants that are broadly helpful for \n> other vaulting schemes, while we develop a proper library that is both \n> performant and efficient for quantum signatures.  \n>\n> secp256k1 has been optimized to the point where timing attacks are \n> challenging,",

While I don't think your solution will work, commit/reveal protocols like this are a great backup plan in case we can't make the larger sizes of real post-quantum signing schemes work at scale. \n\nThe main issue I see with your protocol as described is that unlike other commit/reveal protocols, the \"anchor tx\" as you call it doesn't commit to the reveal TX at all. Once the reveal TX appears in the mempool, a quantum adversary could just copy the secret, invert the public key, and attempt to RBF the reveal TX.\n\nForgive me if the answer lies somewhere in your code, I don't fully understand what it's supposed to be doing.\n\nregards,\nconduition\n\n\nOn Thursday, December 18th, 2025 at 8:49 PM, Erik Aronesty <erik@q32•com> wrote:\n\n> I wrote the python code for this.

          "body": "Hi all,\n\nWe have become aware of a wallet migration bug introduced in Bitcoin \nCore 30.0 and 30.1. Under rare circumstances, when the migration of a \nwallet.dat file fails, all files in the wallet directory may be deleted \nin the process, potentially resulting in a loss of funds. A fix is \nforthcoming and will be released as 30.2, but out of an abundance of \ncaution we have removed the binaries for affected releases from \nbitcoincore.org.\n\nAt this time, we ask users to not attempt wallet migrations using the \nGUI or RPC until v30.2 is released. All other users, including existing \nwallet users, are unaffected and can keep using existing installations.\n\nSpecifically, it requires the presence of a default (unnamed) wallet.dat \nfile, which has not been created by default since 0.21 (released 5 years \nago), that fails to be migrated or loaded. One condition that may \ntrigger this is when pruning is enabled, and the wallet was unloaded \nwhile pruning happened.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/f498b9ad-c3e1-40bb-8325-4df6bbf74cd7%40achow101.com.",

Over the past few years, I’ve been\nworking intermittently on proposals for 64-bit arithmetic [0] and amount\nlocks [1], which I think fall squarely into this category.\n\nIf I were sitting on a grant committee, I would want to see soft-fork\nproposals designed as modular components that can be reused as part of\nlarger soft forks. When the same functionality is reimplemented across\nmultiple proposals, that’s usually a strong signal that the feature is\nbroadly needed.\n\nThe work I cited above was inspired by the OP_TAPLEAFUPDATEVERIFY soft-fork\nproposal [2]. I deconstructed that larger proposal into smaller,\nindependent pieces. Two of those pieces were:\n\n   -\n\n   Adding 64-bit arithmetic to Script to properly handle satoshi amounts,\n   and\n   -\n\n   Introducing an opcode (OP_INOUT_AMOUNT) to push amounts onto the stack.\n\nAfter doing this, I realized that there are several other proposals in the\nspace that could reuse this same functionality [3][4][5].\n\nBecause of this, I think funding work on small, reusable components that\ncan be composed into “larger” soft forks could be both useful and\ninteresting.\n\nBelow are objective milestones that a grantee could complete, with funds\ndisbursed at each stage. Some of these milestones I’ve already achieved\nwith the cited proposals; others are still TODO:\n\n*Level 1:* Implement the proposal in a language of choice (Python, C++,\nRust, etc.).\n*Level 2:* Write a BIP describing the soft-fork proposal.\n*Level 3:* Implement the BIP in the latest Bitcoin Core release, including\nPython and/or C++ test cases.\n*Level 4:* Produce static test vectors for the BIP [6] and integrate them\ninto a second Bitcoin implementation (e.g., btcd, bitcoin-s, bcoin).\n*Level 5:* Validate the proposal by using it *inside* larger soft-fork\nproposals. This would involve forking existing soft-fork code, removing the\noriginal implementation of the relevant feat",

This mechanism \nis intended for wallets that are going to remain untouched for a long time.\n\nAn example implementation can be found in the Timelock Recovery plugin that \nI've implemented for Electrum <https://electrum.org> (merged since Electrum \nv4.6.0b1). Details and demo videos can be found at: \nhttps://timelockrecovery.com.\nThe plugin creates a UI for signing the two transactions, then saving them \neither in a PDF file (with de",

First and foremost, BIP 3 is likely to be adopted before Safe\nRedaction, so this is basic future-proofing. Additionally, this may be the\nfirst time BIP 3 has been used to draft a new BIP, and so this may add\nconstructive support for the adoption of BIP 3, or highlight issues, or\nsimply help to raise awareness and progress the discussion.\n\nAs described in BIP 3, the purpose of this email is to invite BIP editors\nand other community members to comment on the proposal, in regard to:\n\n* Novelty of the idea\n* Viability, utility, and relevance of the concept\n* Readiness of the proposal\n* On-topic for the Bitcoin community\n\nOf course, I am also keen to hear any and all thoughts on this proposal,\nfrom any perspective. Community interest is a requirement for any new BIP,\nso if you are interested, please speak up.\n\nIf you would like to have a more in-depth conversation than this\ndistribution list can practically support, you are invited to join the\nDiscord server.

Using commitments at each stage \nnaturally prevents MITM-style substitution and eliminates replay attacks by \nconstruction. As several participants noted, this makes it a safer and more \nincremental starting point than moving directly to full quantum-safe \nsignature\nschemes.\n\nOne strength of beginning with a commit-and-reveal path is that it allows \nthe ecosystem to develop a quantum-resilient vault mechanism and a broadly \nuseful covenant primitive without introducing\npremature trust assumptions. It also provides time to build a well-audited, \nperformance-optimized\nlibrary for quantum-safe commitments before addressing the much more \ncomplex migration to PQ\nsignatures.\n\nBy comparison, quantum-safe signature libraries are not yet engineered \nanywhere near the maturity\nof secp256k1, which is optimized to the point where timing side channels \nare extremely difficult to\nexploit. Moving too quickly toward full PQ signatures seems unnecessary at \nthis stage.\n\nIn parallel with this discussion, I have been working on a complementary \nframework focusing on the\nverification bottlenecks and scalability issues of hash-based PQ signatures \nin Bitcoin. The design,\ncalled **QRMVL (Quantum-Resilient Modular Verification Layer)**, aims to \nprovide a soft-fork–compatible,\nincremental path toward PQ validation while preserving current validation \nsemantics.\n\nKey components of QRMVL include:\n• Hybrid hash-based signatures (stateful LMS + stateless SPHINCS+)  \n• A STARK-style Linear Hash Tree (LHT) enabling parallelizable Merkle \nverification  \n• Deterministic UTXO-bound LMS index to avoid state-reuse problems  \n• A fail-fast node pipeline designed to reduce PQC DoS exposure  \n• Tiered P2PQS levels (Lite / Standard / High)  \n• Fully backward-compatible witness extensions (v2/v3) with no txid \nmodifications  \n\nResources \n",

Another one, as laid out in BIP-352 [1], is \nto\ndo it backwards: for each taproot output, subtract the output candidate and\ncheck if the result is in the label cache. One advantage of this approach is\nthat its scanning cost is independent of the number of labels to scan for, \nas\nthe lookup time in the cache is constant and efficient if a proper data\nstructure is used.\n\nTo prove that point, I've extended the scanning benchmark of the libsecp SP\nmodule PR #1765 [2] with an _actual_ label cache using a third-party hash\ntable implementation [3]:\nhttps://github.com/theStack/secp256k1/commit/f9f41adcedaca98aa4f3f65e2782e25b2124bf85\n\nThe scanning time is measured with three different label cache sizes: no\nentries (i.e. empty lookup function stub, no hash-map involved), one entry\n(\"tiny\"), and one million entries (\"huge\"). Running the benchmark for \nscanning\na transaction with 10 taproot outputs leads to the following output:\n\n$ ./build/bin/bench sp_scan_with_labels\nBenchmark                               ,    Min(us)    ,    Avg(us)    ,   \n Max(us)\n\nsp_scan_with_label_cache_empty_L=0      ,    61.3       ,    61.4       ,   \n 61.4\nsp_scan_with_label_cache_tiny_L=1       ,    61.6       ,    61.6       ,   \n 61.7\nsp_scan_with_label_cache_huge_L=1000000 ,",

Every DustSweep tx should monotonically\nreduce the UTXO set and never meaningfully compete with the fee market. As\nlong as that holds, I’m not particularly attached to any one parameter.\n\nI agree that requiring 100% dust inputs and exactly one output is probably\noverly strict in practice. A majority dust requirement and an output/input\nratio cap seem like reasonable ways to preserve the incentive (net UTXO\nreduction) while making it more usable for real wallets.\n\nMy main goal here is to give operators something that’s safe to run and\npredictable in behaviour — cheap, bounded, and only active when blockspace\nwould otherwise go unused. I’m happy to adjust thresholds or relax\nconstraints as long as those properties remain intact.\n\nAppreciate you taking the time to look at it.\n\nKind regards,\n\nDefenwycke\n\nOn Fri, Dec 12, 2025 at 6:16 PM Jonathan Voss <k98kurz@gmail•com> wrote:\n\n> Interesting proposal.

As\npointed out earlier in response to your post, the MTP rule would prevent a chain\nsplit by making sure the legacy chain halts.\n\nFurthermore, even if it was a goal to fix the timestamp overflow through a soft\nfork, the issue will arise so far in the future that it does not justify making\ninferior protocol decisions to fix bugs that exist today (and that could become\nmore problematic within the next decade).\n\nYou came up with a clever hack to address the DoS concern, which somewhat\nreminds me of forward blocks. It makes it possible to still validate cumulative\nwork from a chain of headers, but it relies on actively exploiting Timewarp\nthere. This is unfortunate in itself but also means breaking timestamp-based\ntimelocks which, as people pointed out here and on your Delving thread, entails\nfreezing coins that rely on them.\n\nTherefore my preference is to fix properly Timewarp with BIP 54, and properly\ndeal with the timestamp overflow when (if?) necessary.\n\nBest,\nAntoine Poinsot\n\n\nOn Monday, December 15th, 2025 at 2:30 PM, Josh Doman <joshsdoman@gmail•com> wrote:\n\n> > your idea is to have the header nTime used for difficulty adjustment enforced in the coinbase tx.\n> Correct.

There is certainly a tradeoff. On the one hand, there is a risk of coin confiscation, if the soft fork isn't signaled early enough (a few decades in advance is probably sufficient).

Because of this, a stable implementation of silent payments in the project depends of the specifications of BIP 352 for this format. BIP 375 and BIP 374 are core component for this.\n\nHowever, there is a need for the inclusion of silent payments tweaks in PSBTs to spend silent payment outputs, which was considered before [1][2] but never specified.\n\nI would like to propose the following as a base for a new BIP proposal addressing this gap:\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis document proposes additional fields for BIP 370 PSBTv2 that allow for BIP 352 silent payment tweaks to be included in a PSBT of version 2. These will be fields for scripts that are relevant to the spending of silent payment outputs, but may be also useful to other protocols using taproot tweaks not following BIP 340 spec.\n\n### Motivation\n\nBIPs 352 specify silent payments protocol, which provides a new way to create P2TR outputs and spend them. The existing PSBT fields are unable to support silent payments without changes, due to the new method by which outputs are created. BIP 375 and complementary BIP 374 specify how to create outputs locked with silent payment keys using PSBTs. But they don't specify how to unlock these outputs in a transaction. Therefore new fields must be defined to allow PSBTs to carry the information necessary for tweaking taproot keys without following the BIP 340 tagging scheme.\n\n### Specification\n\nThe new per-input types are defined as follows:\n\n| Name              | \\<keytype\\>               | \\<keydata\\> | <keydata\\><br>Description | \\<valuedata\\>    | \\<valuedata\\><br>Description                                                                                 | \\<Versions Requiring Inlusion\\> | \\<Versions Requiring Exclusion\\> | \\<Versions Allowing Inclusion\\> |\n| ----------------- | --------",

A feedback mechanism sets a dynamic dust level, below from which UTXOs are removed/discarded and thus freeing RAM.\n\nBelow is an overview essay better expressed by grok, which can also be seen in here:\nhttps://hackmd.io/P-2lzGb8TiC86IOE3OGiYA?view\n\n# Enhancing Bitcoin's Scalability: A PID-Inspired Approach to Managing UTXO Set Growth\n\n## Abstract\n\nBitcoin’s UTXO set is currently an unbounded accumulator that risks long-term centralization as node RAM requirements grow without limit. Existing fee incentives have proven insufficient against sustained low-value output creation (e.g., inscriptions, tokenized assets, dust-heavy protocols). This article proposes a soft-fork mechanism that treats UTXO set size as a controlled variable: a slowly rising target size is defined, and a PID-style feedback controller, updated every difficulty epoch, dynamically raises a minimum-value floor beneath which old UTXOs become unspendable. The result is bounded, predictable growth of the UTXO set with ample warning periods, no hard caps on monetary use, and strong resistance to bloat attacks—all while remaining fully compatible with a soft-fork deployment.\n\n## Introduction\n\nBitcoin, the pioneering decentralized digital currency, operates as a complex dynamic system governed by consensus rules that ensure security, immutability, and permissionless participation. At its core, Bitcoin maintains a distributed ledger known as the blockchain, which records all transactions in a sequence of blocks. Each transaction involves inputs and outputs: inputs reference previously unspent outputs from prior transactions, while outputs create new spendable units called Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). The UTXO set represents the aggregate state of all currently spendable coins in the network, serving as a critica",

          "body": "Thanks both Eric and Erik for the replies. I can't answer whether RAM requirements due to UTXO would indeed be a problem or not. I think a worse-case performance could be considered assuming a \"no-RAM\" environment.\n\nThis being said, I wanted to share some insights still related to the dynamic dust mechanism (the essay).\n\n1. This proposal could be named \"dynamic dust\" plus \"dust sweeping\". Dynamic dust refers to the dust level being defined by the controller at every epoch, and dust sweeping refers to deprecation of utxos below that dust threshold.\n\n2. The grace period for the sweep, individual for each transaction, allows for a new perspective. This is, again, better portrayed by Grok:\n\n## Annex: Addressing Concerns of Confiscation in UTXO Deprecation\n\nWhile the proposed PID-inspired mechanism for UTXO set management offers a pathway to enhanced scalability, it has elicited valid criticisms, particularly regarding its confiscatory nature. Deprecating low-value UTXOs could be perceived as an involuntary seizure of assets, undermining Bitcoin's principles of ownership and immutability. This concern merits careful consideration, as any protocol change must preserve user trust and avoid arbitrary interventions.\n\nThe proposal maintains a degree of neutrality by evaluating UTXOs solely based on their satoshi (SAT) value, without interpreting their content or purpose. This objective criterion minimizes subjective judgments, applying uniformly across all outputs regardless of their origin or use case.\n\nA key mitigating factor lies in the incorporation of a grace period—typically spanning 6 to 12 months—during which owners of affected UTXOs can consolidate or spend them without direct penalty. This window transforms the deprecation process from outright confiscation into a dynamic incentive structure, favoring resource allocation in a constrained system. In Bitcoin's ecosystem, users already incur ongoing costs for participation, such as transaction fees, which can render lo",

The very early work-in-progress description is\non GitHub: https://github.com/laissez-faire-btc/safe-remove\n\nI won't include all the details here, because there's necessarily a lot to\ncover, but the basic design goals I've aimed to address are something like\nthis:\n\n* optional - each node gets to decide what to remove, if anything\n* safe - provably no harm is done to those not choosing to use it, and any\ncost or risk to those using it is well understood, minimal, and mitigated\n* full node functionality - a node that does remove content can still do\neverything it could have done otherwise, without relying on anyone else\n* retrospective - content that exists on the blockchain today\n(pre-implementation) can be removed later (post-implementation)\n* trustless, verifiable, permissionless - control messages enabling data to\nbe removed are simple verifiable statements of fact that can be written by\nanybody\n* lightweight - minimal changes and impact to policy, consensus,\nimplementation, usage, the economy\n* granularity, associativity, commutability, idempotence - the least\npossible data is removed, and ordering is inconsequential\n* transferable - nodes that choose to remove objectionable content can\nshare those blocks (with content removed) with others who hold the same\nobjection, so that the receiver may never even momentarily hold the\nobjectionable content\n\nBeing design goals, these are probably not all achievable. I'll need your\nhelp to work through all the details.\n\nI have some more notes I just haven't written up yet, so I'm keen for your\ninput please, on what direction I should take, questions I should answer,\naspects I should consider or detail further, etc.\n\nIn the absence of any feedback, I'll be proceeding with either documenting\nthe threat model, or a bit of a literature review - starting with the\nfollowi",

Some wallet devs \n*today* don't even bother with multi-address support, so imagine if to do \nso effeciently, they needed to statefully track prior UTXOs and generate \naddresses based on a changing UTXO set over time.\n\nAlso I want to mention, there's a big privacy difference between these CISA \ntechniques, and CISA via address reuse. \n\nIf I receive two payments to the same address, i immediately reveal that \nthose UTXOs are owned by the same entity: me.\n\nIf I receive two payments to *distinct* addresses which are linked via your \nOP_CIV (or via my idea by committing to pubkeys) then I can choose when and \nwhether to reveal the fact that those UTXOs are commonly owned. Most user \nwallets have more than just two UTXOs, so in a setting where I have \npossibly dozens of UTXOs, this offers me more flexibility with respect to \nmy on-chain privacy, allowing me to choose when and how to reveal common \nUTXO ownership. This is kind of already the status quo, because chainalysis \nuses common-input ownership heuristics even if they are flawed/incorrect, \njust for the sake of having a \"working\" tool they can sell.\n\nRegarding the extra cost, we can quantify that! Let's say we have a taptree \nof height `h` with `2^h` leaves. We use one leaf for a unique pubkey, and \nthe other `2^h - 1` tap leaves store commitments to other pubkeys or to \npre-existing UTXOs. To spend a TX with `n` inputs using this CISA paradigm, \nwe need one signature, plus `n - 1` taproot control blocks and tapscripts. \nEach control block has size `h * 32`, plus ~32 bytes to reference the other \npubkey or UTXO in the locking tapscript. So in total, the witness size \nscales as: `(n - 1)((h + 1) * 32)`. In other words, for every additional \ninput covered by the CISA scheme, we must pay for roughly `(h + 1) * 32",

Attacker must break BOTH ECDSA AND know the \nhash preimages - quantum computers can't reverse SHA256.\n\nCOMPARISON TO BIP-360:\n- BIP-360: New lattice-based crypto, 1.3-50 KB sigs, breaks BIP-32\n- Q-Lock: Proven SHA256 crypto, ~3 KB sigs, BIP-32 works\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n1. Setup: Generate 64 random secrets, commit via Merkle root\n2. Commit phase: Lock outputs WITHOUT exposing pubkey\n3. Reveal phase: Expose pubkey + secrets at block-hash-determined positions\n4. Quantum attacker sees pubkey too late - outputs already locked!\n\n```\nQ-Lock is a quantum-resistant spending protocol for Bitcoin \nthat adds a hash-based secret layer on top of existing ECDSA \nsignatures. It uses a two-phase commit-reveal scheme where \nspending positions are determined by the block hash, making \nit secure against quantum attackers who can break ECDSA.\n\nQ-Lock does NOT replace ECDSA. It adds quantum protection \nwhile preserving Bitcoin's existing cryptographic foundation.\n\nTransaction size: ~3 KB\nRequires: Soft fork (1-2 new opcodes)\n```\n\n-----\n\n## MOTIVATION\n\n```\nTHE QUANTUM THREAT:\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nShor's algorithm can break ECDSA by extracting private keys \nfrom public keys. When a Bitcoin transaction is broadcast, \nthe public key is exposed in the mempool. A quantum attacker \ncould:\n\n1. See public ke",
