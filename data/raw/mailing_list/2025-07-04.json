          "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nTo mitigate high block validation time, BIP54 proposes to make transactions which require more than\n2500 legacy signature operations invalid by consensus. The 2500 figure was chosen as the tightest\nvalue that did not make any non-pathological currently standard transaction invalid.\n\nNo transaction in Bitcoin's history would have both hit the BIP54 sigop limit and been standard\naccording to today's Bitcoin Core policy[^0]. But what happened in the past doesn't matter as much\nas the fact that it is possible today to create a pathological standard transaction that is\nBIP54-invalid.\n\nThis opens up a major DoS vector against unupgraded miners if BIP54 ever gets activated in these\nconditions. Therefore i propose to make such transactions non-standard and hold off activation of\nBIP54 until we have good reasons to believe that the vast majority of the hashrate won't create a\nblock containing such a transaction.\n\nDoing so gives better guarantees in case BIP54 is ever considered for activation, and comes at\nvirtually no cost since these pathological transactions have never been used and serve no purpose\nbeyond increasing the cost of validation. Bitcoin Core PR #32521 implements this change, which i\nhope to get into the upcoming 30.0 release as well as backported to previous versions.\n\nBest,\nAntoine Poinsot\n\n[^0]: Here the full list of historical transactions that would have hit the BIP54 sigops limit:\n    - 659135664894e50040830edb516a76f704fd2be409ecd8d1ea9916c002ab28a2\n    - bea1c2b87fee95a203c5b5d9f3e5d0f472385c34cb5af02d0560aab973169683\n    - 24b16a13c972522241b65fbb83d09d4bc02ceb33487f41d1f2f620b047307179\n    - 53666009e036171b1aee099bc9cd3cb551969a53315410d13ad5390b8b4f3bd0\n    - ffc178be118bc2f9eaf016d1c942aec18441a6c5ec17c9d92d1da7962f0479f6\n    - 2f1654561297114e434c4aea5ca715e4e3f10be0be8c1c9db2b6f68ea76dae09\n    - 62fc8d091a7c597783981f00b889d72d24ad5e3e224dbe1c2a317aabef89217e\n    - d939315b180d3d73b5e316eb57a18f8137a3f5943aef21a811660d25f1080a3f\n   ",

In the past, I made really rough math for \n1000-sized participants\npayments pools, where for the funding_tx, you have the 1000 participants \ncontributing\none input with one sig for each [0]. \n\nIn my understanding the new limit of 2500 signatures operation would make a \nhard-limit\nfor the number of participants entering in such construction, without other \ntricks that\nare consuming more block space. One can note the downside on funding tx of \nhigh-order\noff-chain construction, if a max tx size consensus limit is introduced in \nthe future.\n\nOf course, I do not deny the DoS rational of introducing the 2500 sig limit \nand it's\nvery needed. At the same time, we should be careful of not closing too much \ndoors for\nfuture off-chain constructions and long-term tx throughput scalability.\n\nI do believe, it's always technically possible in the future to introduce \nnew opcode\nor segwit versions scripts (e.g grafroot or entroot-based pool \nconstruction), which\nwouldn't be subject to the new limit, and as such more scalable. If I'm \ncorrect, I\nthink it's all about how the limit is implemented to parse current scripts \nto be\nspent.\n\nBut it's hard to say without code available to review and reason. May I \nkindly note\nthere is no reference implementation attached in the current BIP54 document \n[1]. Even,\nif it's often updated, it's always fruitful to have code under the eyes for \nreview.\n\nThis might be the kind of concern (very) far down the line...but preserving \nthe\nevolvability of the consensus rules is a good property to care about, in my \nhumble\nopinion.\n\nBest,\nRiard\nOTS hash: a2bb9a1faf79309b039d8ae7e0b951644ca0adb2\n\n[0] \nh",

          "body": "Hi list,\n\nCross-Input Signature Aggregation (CISA) has been a recurring topic here, aiming\nto reduce transaction sizes and verification cost [0]. Tim Ruffing, Yannick\nSeurin and I recently published DahLIAS, the first interactive aggregate\nsignature scheme with constant-size signatures (64 bytes) compatible with\nsecp256k1.\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2025/692.pdf\n\nRecall that in an aggregate signature scheme, each signer contributes their own\nmessage, which distinguishes it from multi- and threshold signatures, where all\nsigners sign the same message. This makes aggregate signature schemes the\nnatural cryptographic primitive for cross-input signature aggregation because\neach transaction input typically requires signing a different message.\n\nPrevious candidates for constant-size aggregate signatures either:\n- Required cryptographic assumptions quite different from the discrete logarithm\n   problem on secp256k1 currently used in Bitcoin signatures (e.g., groups with\n   efficient pairings).\n- Were \"folklore\" constructions, lacking detailed descriptions and security\n   proofs.\n\nBesides presenting DahLIAS, the paper provides a proof that a class of these\nfolklore constructions are indeed secure if the signer does _not_ use key\ntweaking (e.g., no Taproot commitments or BIP 32 derivation). Moreover, we show\nthat there exists a concrete attack against a folklore aggregate signature\nscheme derived from MuSig2 when key tweaking is used.\n\nIn contrast, DahLIAS is proven to be compatible with key tweaking. Moreover, it\nrequires two rounds of communication for signing, where the first round can be\nrun before the messages to be signed are known. Verification of DahLIAS\nsignatures is asymptotically twice as fast as half-aggregate Schnorr signatures\nand as batch verification of individual Schnorr signatures.\n\nWe believe DahLIAS offers an attractive building block for a potential CISA\nproposal and welcome any feedback or discussion.\n\nJonas Nick, Tim Ruffing, Yannick Seurin\n\n\n[0] See, e.",

And I tend \nto agree that this is more natural scheme. In fact, this is where we \nstarted, and we had a security proof of this (though without tweaking \nworked out) in an earlier unpublished draft of the paper, and only \nafterwards we found a scheme with a single b.\n\nI see. Funnily enough, the day after I posted \"my idea\" I saw that ~ the \nsame thing exists in the original FROST paper!\n\n> The reason we why prefer the scheme with a single b is simply \nefficiency. The current signing protocol needs 3 group exponentiations \n(i.e., scalar-point multiplications). With separate b values, one of \nthose becomes a multi-exponentiation of size n-1, which is much slower \nand needs O(n/log n) time instead of O(1).\n\nOK. I can see where the count of 3 comes from and, indeed, we would need a \nmultiexponentiation in signing, here. But, we already need one in verifying.\nSo we'd be going from from O(1) sign, O(n/logn) verify to O(n/logn) sign, \nO(n/logn) verify. As per table 1, the only one that's better than that \nwhile being unrestricted is BN06, but that isn't a 2 round scheme.\n\nMy initial reaction would be, since it's not worsening the scaling of the \nverifier, does it matter? And *if* this were only for Bitcoin, then also \nbecause n is limited in that context with some upper bound (in the hundreds \nI think). A multiexp in signing for 100 inputs with n/logn scaling seems \nlike it wouldn't be an issue since, after all, we are assuming we can do it \nin transaction verification. Signers being more constrained than verifiers \ndoesn't seem realistic; am I missing something there? (hardware signing \ndevices perhaps? is that an actual concern, given signers have so much more \ntime than verifiers? perhaps Lightning-like protocols (though not LN itself \nI think)?)\n\nThe scheme",

Wait until it has \ncompletely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on \nmacOS)\nor `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its \nEOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be \nmigrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n\nCompatibility\n==============\n\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer. Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other UNIX-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\n\nNotable changes\n===============\n\n### Build\n\n- #31407 guix: Notarize MacOS app bundle and codesign all MacOS and \nWindows binaries\n- #31500 depends: Fix compiling libevent package on NetBSD\n- #31627 depends: Fix spacing issue\n- #32070 build: use make < 3.82 syntax for define directive\n- #32439 guix: accomodate migration to codeberg\n- #32568 depends: use \"mkdir -p\" when installing xproto\n- #32693 depends: fix cmake compatibility error for freetype\n\n### Test\n\n- #32286 test: Handle empty string returned by CLI as None in RPC tests\n- #32336 test: Suppress upstream -Wduplicate-decl-specifier in bpfcc\n\n### Tracing\n\n- #31623 tracing: Rename the MIN macro to TRACEPOINT_TEST_MIN in \nlog",

In this case the only thing an attacker \nneeds is to acquire 2 BTC. They would also earn fees from coinjoin being a \nmaker.\n\nIndeed hedging is something to consider when analyzing cost of timelocking \ncoins. It's not obvious what its effect is, but it certainly doesn't remove \nthe \"opportunity cost\"/\"sacrifice\" (i.e. the cost derived from the time \nvalue of money), and thus doesn't invalidate the idea of using a timelock \nto create a nontrivial cost to attack the system. What it does it remove \none aspect of cost, which comes from the volatility in the \"true value\" \n(however you want to measure that, e.g. purchasing power) of the asset \n(here, 1 BTC), but with the additional cost of locking more capital (and \ntransaction costs, and ..). But with or without hedging, the *main* aspect \nof cost remains: you forego the opportunity to use those funds otherwise, \nduring the locked period; the monetary value of that opportunity cost is a \nlot less than the 1 BTC, of course, for only 3 months, but it is a lot \ngreater than zero.\n\nOn to calculating costs:\n\nIn this other part of my reply, I wrote:\n\n> Just a pure \"I own a utxo\" imposes no, or negligible cost. As per the \ndelving post, and in a few other places, I've noted you can impose an age \nand value restriction to bump up the cost.\n\nSo your idea of calculating that is certainly something I considered, \nthough, how exactly one constructs the right kind of formula isn't that \nobvious. I had something like age^a * value ^ b whereas you are looking at \nstraight multiplication in your linked gitlab note  (so I guess a=1, b=1) \n(also you weight by utxo type, but I guess that's a very small delta).

A PR resolving this discrepancy by moving that test \nfrom the invalid to the valid section was merged, but there is still a \nquestion of whether this was the right course of action.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin Core does not implement this, and AFAICT, neither \ndoes rust-miniscript. There is an open PR to Bitcoin Core to allow `H` \n(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32788), but ongoing discussion \nsuggests that perhaps the BIP should be modified instead as it seems \nprobable that no implementation of descriptors allows `H`.\n\nSo the question is: are there any implementations of descriptors that \nemit descriptors that use `H` as a hardened indicator, or permit `H` as \na hardened indicator?\n\nI think the former question is more useful to know as it is more \nimportant that the descriptor implementations can parse each other's \nproducts. It is possible that there are implementations that allow `H` \nbut do not emit `H`, since there are libraries that provide BIP 32 \nutilities which allow `H`.\n\nThanks\nAva\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/848d3d4b-94a5-4e7c-b178-62cf5015b65f%40achow101.com.",

Schoolbook Winternitz\none-time signatures, forest-of-trees few-time signatures, and Merkle trees\nall validate signatures (/authentication paths) by recomputing the public\nkey (/Merkle tree root) from the signature and the message, and checking\nwhether the recomputed public key matches the actual public key. That means\nwe can pick anything for the signature, and just set the public key to the\nrecomputed public key.\n\nThe situation is more subtle for actual standardized hash-based signatures.\nRFC 8391 XMSS doesn’t sign the message itself, but first hashes in (among\nothers) the public key. Basically the best we can do for XMSS (except for\nsetting the signature randomizer) is to guess the public key. Thus it’s\npretty much jpeg resistant.\n\nThe situation is different again for RFC 8391 XMSSMT. XMSSMT is basically a\ncertificate chain of XMSS signatures. An XMSSMT public key is an XMSS\npublic key. An XMSSMT signature is a chain of XMSS signatures: the XMSSMT\npublic key signs another XMSS public key; which signs another public XMSS\npublic key; …; which signs the message. Again the top XMSSMT public key is\nhashed into the message signed, but that only binds the first XMSS\nsignature. We can’t mess with the first signature, but the other signatures\nwe can choose freely, as those roots are not bound. Thus XMSSMT with two\nsubtrees is only half jpeg resistant and it gets worse with more subtrees.\n\nSimilarly SLH-DSA (FIPS 205, née SPHINCS+) is a certificate chain of (a\nvariant of) XMSS signing another XMSS public key, which si",

Hence we have seen Knots, Libre Relay etc introduce \ndifferent mempool policies to Core without a chain split or a split of the \nnetwork. The recent statement by Core stating what its current contributors \nprioritize when designing transaction relay policy [3] and the \ncommunication around the recent transaction relay policy pull request \n(#32404) merge decision [4] I thought was excellent. However to take that \nprecedent on Core *transaction relay policy* (a signed statement by a set \nof Core contributors and signposting around the merge decision) and assume \nit can be applied to a *consensus rule change* (CTV and CSFS or whatever \nthe current set of opcodes is currently in vogue) requesting Core \ncontributors prioritize review within 6 months is short sighted to put it \nmildly. Core can make unilateral decisions on transaction policy because \nconsensus compatible forks can have different transaction policy without \nsplitting the chain or the network.

That's most unfortunate. While this is getting silly, I can't \nhelp wondering what happens, in the presence of an ECDLP breaker, to a \nbotched version of taproot that requires script-path spending and doesn't \nallow key-path.\n\nIt's interesting, imagine: honest keyholder creates Q = P_N + H(P_N||S)G \nwhere P_N means NUMS internal key. ECDLP breaker can just find DL of Q but \nif we disallow key-path spend they have to open a hash commitment to a \ntweak as per usual taproot rules.\n\nSo they need: Q = P_2 +H(P_2||S_2)G now, they know the full private key x_N \n+ H(P_N||S) for Q (and they may or may not know S, or be able to guess it, \nto get all the variables in that expression), but it seems to not help them \ngiven the commitment to P_2 in the hash, requiring them to choose P_2 \nbefore the hash.\n\nThey could of course do it with P_N itself, if that were allowed, hence the \n\"disable NUMS\" might make sense, in this scenario. Can't say I'm 100% sure \nof myself here, but it looks like that works.\n\nEven if I'm right, it's not so interesting; we already are assuming that a \nquantum attacker can't break hashes, that's behind a lot of the discussion \nhere, so of course it would make sense if we broke taproot to require it \nonly to use hashes (script path only), then it might come back to the same \nsecurity situation (which of course, is not actual security, since keys are \nalways revealed in spending).

I found that the discursive detail avoided some \nconfusions I had with Tim's and Adam's earlier descriptions, though there \nare clearly a ton of subtle differences in the various designs.\n\nAnyway, one detail: you have h(pubkey), h(pubkey,txid), txid. You note \nearlier that h should be tagged for domain separation purposes. But if you \nmeant literally the same h for the first two components of the tuple, \nthere's a flaw, depending on h; length extension attacks could allow the \ncreation of h(pubkey,txid') without knowing pubkey. I'm going to ignore the \ntrickier question of whether that matters based on how txid is derived from \na transaction (given txid vs wtxid, I guess it actually really does). \nPresumably just use h2 which differs from h, either a different hash or a \ndifferent prefix, to avoid this. And/or swapping h(txid,pubkey) etc. \nObviously using h() that is not susceptible to LEA avoids the Q being \nraised, but that may be more or less easy in Bitcoin-land.\n\nCheers,\nAdamISZ/waxwing\n\nOn Wednesday, May 28, 2025 at 2:28:25 PM UTC-3 Tadge Dryja wrote:\n\n> One of the tricky things about securing Bitcoin against quantum computers \n> is: do you even need to?

Yes, hand computing the checksum for BIP-93 is a pain, but\nunlike BIP-39's checksum, it is actually doable.  And unlike BIP-39's\nchecksum, the checksum for codex32 is actually an error-correcting code, so\nyou can actually repair errors and erasures in the data.

The EC signature signs\n> the second transaction, which depends on the QR output's txid, which\n> in turn depends on the precommitted EC signature.\n\nSorry, my wording was vague in my last message. I was picturing an\narbitrary EC signature, possibly on a static message,\ne.g. sign(\"i was here first!\", sk). Not an EC signature on the\nreveal transaction, because you're right - that would be a cyclical\ndependency.\n\nI was thinking we commit to sha256(sign(static_msg, sk)) using a\nquantum-protected address in the commitment stage. In the reveal\ntransaction, we open the commitment by revealing \n\nsign(static_msg, sk), spending both the QR and EC UTXOs.\n\nHowever, I like your idea of committing to the pubkey instead of a\nsignature - it's simpler. As you said, we can't give the QC attacker\nopportunities to steal and so the commitment must be hidden until it\nis revealed when it comes time to spend the EC output. This applies\nto any kind of commit/reveal scheme, whether we use signatures or\npubkeys.\n\nThe exact mechanics will depend on what commitment mechanisms are\navailable to users of the hypothetical quantum-resistant script pubkey.\nBest case is we hope to have a taproot-like tweaking mechanism that\nlets us hide a commitment in the QR output script, or we use a P2SH\nwrapping layer around a hypothetical quantum-resistant checksig\nopcode, and hide the committed data in an inscription-like envelope\nwhich is opened by the reveal transaction.\n\n\nFor better scaling, we probably want to commit some kind of\naccumulator, rather than just a single raw hash. Otherwise you'd\nneed one QR UTXO to spend every locked EC UTXO, which isn't very\nefficient. For instance, say you have 10 locked EC utxos you want\nto rescue using a single QR output. You create a new QR output\nwhich hides a commitment to sha256(pk0, pk1, ...pk9) (or a merkle\ntree root of same). This way, a single QR ",

This standardness rule falls into the third category: it aims to mildly deter data storage while still allowing a less harmful alternative than using non-provably-unspendable outputs.\n\nDevelopers are now designing constructions that work around these limitations. An example is Clementine, the recently-announced Citrea bridge, which uses unspendable Taproot outputs to store data in its \"WatchtowerChallenge\" transaction due to the standardness restrictions on the size of OP_RETURNs[^0]. Meanwhile, we have witnessed in recent years that the nudge is ineffective to deter storing data onchain.\n\nSince the restrictions on the usage of OP_RETURN outputs encourage harmful practices while being ineffective in deterring unwanted usage, i propose to drop them. I suggest to start by lifting the restriction on the size of the scriptPubKey for OP_RETURN outputs, as a first minimal step to stop encouraging harmful behaviour, and to then proceed to lift the restriction on the number of OP_RETURN outputs per transactions.\n\nAntoine Poinsot\n\n[^0]: See section 6.1 of their whitepaper here https://citrea.xyz/clementine_whitepaper.pdf\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/rhfyCHr4RfaEalbfGejVdolYCVWIyf84PT2062DQbs5-eU8BPYty5sGyvI3hKeRZQtVC7rn_ugjUWFnWCymz9e9Chbn7FjWJePllFhZRKYk%3D%40protonmail.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #2: Type: text/html, Size: 3508 bytes --]",

I have also written my point of view and reasons for proposing this change in a blog post which goes into more details: https://antoinep.com/posts/relay_policy_drama.\n\nGoing through the emails in order.\n\n> Am I the only one left on this list who actually cares about Bitcoin's survival?\n\nThanks Luke for your measured take. It's refreshing to see we have adults on both sides of this \"debate\".\n\n> With that history in mind, removing limits on OP_RETURN standardness size is pointless.\n\nYes, it is pointless for people who want to store massive amount of data. It is not for people who want to store a small amount of data in a time-sensitive transaction's output. Because they need their transaction to be relayed on the p2p network, and are therefore pushed to use unspendable outputs instead.\n\n> Relaxing OP_RETURN size limits without dealing with the inscriptions\n\nThis is orthogonal. The harmful behaviour described in OP is possible today regardless of inscriptions.\n\n> There's little to no incentive to use OP_RETURN for data storage when using the 'inscriptions' exploit costs 4x less in transactions. What's the point of having a \"standard\" way to store arbitrary data if the exploit method is 4x cheaper? And the nonstandard version of the exploit allows 4x the data?\n\nYou have obviously not properly read or understood OP. There is no need to speculate about what would happen or not. People are using outputs to store data today​. The only question now is harm reduction: given that people are storing this data in outputs today, do we want to offer a way to do it that does not force every single full node on the network to store their data forever?\n\nThat said i agree that this is not going to change anything for people who try to store large amount of data onchain, they already have",

I do believe you come to your position from your belief on what is in the best interests of Bitcoin, and I respect that.  I realize that you don’t know me, and I can only say that my position is also established with the same intentions.  With that said, I don’t think these types of services are a threat at all.  I think they are essential to a healthy mining network where miners can have some control over a portion of their future revenue streams, especially in the greatly reduced subsidy era we are about to enter.  And, I think the lack of a futures/forward market for blockspace is a major inhibitor to adoption and usage.  Its hard to build a business where access to block space is a necessity without any visibility to the future.  I believe this can be done in a manner that provides openness and transparency, and it would also give us for the first time visibility to future demand and pricing and I think that will be valuable to the enter ecosystem.

Whether I would be considered major or not can be judged by others.\n\nThat said, I suggest being very careful about projecting the current behavior of major miners as the norm or representative of the future.  We are extremely early in the development of the mining industry and there is a high likelihood that over the next few years that there will a dramatic change in the list of major miners – and there very well may be changes in the philosophies and priorities of these miners as well.\n\nI spent most of career in the personal computer industry going back to ’86 (most notably as the CTO of Gateway) and I learned many things from my experience.  One important thing was that the pace with which companies could rise to or fall from prominence was jaw-dropping.  Assuming that “major miners” was meant to mean a group that largely is comprised of pubcos, none of the major players in the mining industry have been doing it for long - with most going public very recently (’22 and ’23).   They but pups as companies and we’ve already seen a huge flameout or two.  The next three to five years will likely result in a few more flameouts and some large new entrants that may approach mining from a completely different perspective.  A second learning I will share from my PC development days was that predicting usages and user behavior is next to impossible.  The safest and most accommodating path is to give as much user optionality/configurability as possible.  My high-level recommendation is to work on paths that give users more choice not less.  This is applies to OP_RETURN but, even more importantly, I think it is the best design direction in general.\n\nTo offer what may be a new lens in which to view miners, I’ll share a bit of my philosophy and vision for my company.
