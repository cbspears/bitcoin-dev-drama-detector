My approach has been to stick with\nScript: even if you prefer other approaches, you should find this\nrestoration and enhancement of script capabilities a useful comparison.\n\nCurrent drafts in \"review me!\" format:\n\n\thttps://github.com/rustyrussell/bips/pull/1\n\nHere is a brief description of each:\n\n1. Varops Budget For Script Runtime Constraint (bip-unknown-varops-budget.mediawiki)\n\nThis extends and generalizes the sigops budget into a \"variable\noperations\" budget, using benchmarks taken from the prototype\nimplementation across various machines.  This budget is per transaction,\nby weight, designed to constrain usage to ensure rapid evaluation\nwithout overly restricting scripting ability.\n\n2. Restoration of Script Capabilities\n\nOnce the safety net of the varops budget is in place, disabled opcodes\ncan be re-enabled, stack object size and total capacity extended, and\nabitrary-length arithmetic restored (though numbers are now always\nunsigned).\n\n3. OP_TX\n\nOnce script can handle large data once more, the problem of\nintrospection is signficantly simplified: we can simply have an opcode\nwhich pushes parts of the current transaction onto the stack.  The\nconcrete design proposed here is a fruitful area for debate and review.\n\n4. New Opcodes for Tapscript v2\n\nThe most speculative part of the series suggests some opcodes which\nwould allow more optimal use of Script: OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK,\nOP_SEGMENT, OP_BYTEREV, OP_ECPOINTADD, OP_INTERNALKEY and OP_MULTI.\nSome of these are old friends, and others may be new to you: I look\nforward to your feedback.\n\nThere is also a prototype implementation we used for testing:\n\n\thttps://github.com/jmoik/bitcoin/tree/gsr\n\nThankyou in advance for your consideration!\nRusty & Julian.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Develop",

This issue is especially common in Namecoin. I see no \nreason why importing private keys, a very basic feature, should be \nrestricted to the point that it's impossible for the average user to \nsucceed. That's why I created the Core-Wallet-Migration-Tools \n<https://github.com/blocktraveler/Core-Wallet-Migration-Tools> in Python.\n\nHowever, it would be much easier to have an 'importprivkeys' RPC for \ndescriptor wallets (not to be confused with the legacy 'importprivkey' \ncall). Pls check my initial thoughts:\n\nProposal: Add importprivkeys RPC (helper for WIF → descriptor import) \n<https://gist.github.com/blocktraveler/3e6198c698a272bd8b13b16e0f13d390>\n\nThx!\nUwe\n\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/ad14b140-9e02-466c-8226-304ec651f4ben%40googlegroups.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #1.2: Type: text/html, Size: 1659 bytes --]",

It could be implemented as a hard fork OR as a consensus that quantum actors can legitimately move funds to safe addresses for protective custody and public good. It could even go forward with no consensuses at all since it is functionally equivalent to a quantum winner-takes-all at the protocol level.\n\nBIP: TBD\nTitle: Quantum Secure Asset Verification & Escrow (QSAVE)\nAuthor: James Tagg\nStatus: Draft\nType: Standards Track\nLayer: Consensus (Consensus / Soft Fork / Hard Fork)\nCreated:\nLicense:\n\nAbstract\n\nThis BIP proposes QSAVE (Quantum Secure Asset Verification & Escrow) - a non-sovereign wealth fund providing protective custody for Bitcoin vulnerable to quantum attack (see Appendix for detailed vulnerability assessment). QSAVE preserves 100% of the principal for rightful owners while using generated returns to fund the protocol and global public good. It provides an alternative to the QRAMP (Quantum Resistant Asset Migration Protocol) proposal (which makes coins unspendable) or taking no action (which allows quantum appropriation, which many view as theft). This proposal addresses coins that are dormant but acknowledges there may be coins that have quantum watermarks but have not migrated to quantum addresses. A separate BIP proposal will address this case.\n\nMotivation\n\nChain analysis reveals 3.5-5.5 million Bitcoin (~17-28% of circulating supply) have exposed public keys vulnerable to quantum attack (see Appendix: Quantum Vulnerability Assessment for detailed breakdown).\n\nWith sufficient education and proactive migration, a significant portion of the 2-4M BTC in reused addresses could be moved to quantum-safe addresses before the threat materializes. Modern wallets are increasingly implementing best practices such as always sending change to fresh addresses. However,",

Together, they address the absence \nof an interoperable, canonical, secure format for wallet backups and \ntransfers.\n\n*1. Standard Encrypted Wallet Payload*\nA CBOR based format for serialising wallet data — including \ndescriptor-based accounts, optional transactions/UTXOs, metadata, and root \nsecrets. It cleanly separates the core data structure from its \ncryptographic protection, with encryption mandated via a companion \nstandard. This builds on BIPs 329, 380, 388, and 389, emphasising \nextensibility and deterministic encoding to enable reliable restores across \nwallets.\nThe draft BIP can be found here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/KeysSoze/7109a7f0455897b1930f851bde6337e3\n\n\n*2. Standard Wallet Encryption Envelope*\nA secure, versioned container for encrypting the payload using a password \nderived key with Argon2id, with scope for future extensions such as \nasymmetric encryption. It aims to provide robust protection while keeping \nthe format modular and library-agnostic.\nThe draft BIP can be found here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/KeysSoze/866d009ccd082edf6802df240154b20d\n\n\nBoth drafts are at a very early stage. I’m seeking feedback on the overall \napproach, technical details, potential gaps, and ways to improve them \nbefore formalising further or submitting PRs to the BIPs repository.\n\nThanks in advance for your review and input.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/06b5d067-7293-4618-b3c5-510380a55efan%40googlegroups.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #1.2: Type: text/html, Size: 2208 bytes --]",

This allows wallets to derive codex32 \nbackups from BIP-0032 master keys.\n\n*Summary* \n\n   - \n   \n   Application number: 93'\n   - Derivation path: \n   m/83696968'/93'/{hrp}'/{threshold}'/{n}'/{byte_length}'/{id0}'/{id1}'/{id2}'/{id3}'/{index}' \n   \nCodex32, defined in BIP-93, is a human-readable encoding with checksumming \nand share indexing designed for SSS backups of BIP-0032 seeds. This PR \nproposes a deterministic way to generate codex32 strings using BIP-85.\n\n*Rationale* \n\n   - \n   \n   Mirrors the existing BIP-85 application for BIP-39.\n   - \n   \n   Codex32 offers error correction, hand verification, identifiers, and \n   secret sharing features compared to BIP-39.\n   - \n   \n   Adds a standardized way for wallets to generate codex32 backups from \n   BIP-85-derived entropy\n   - \n   \n   Test vectors and reference implementation are linked to in the PR.\n   \n*Risks and alternatives* \n\n   - \n   \n   Wallet adoption of codex32 is still limited, though a draft PR #32652 \n   <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32652?utm_source=chatgpt.com> \n   for importing codex32 strings to Bitcoin Core has support.\n   - Codex32 implementers could use the BIP-85 dice application, but \n   defining a direct application improves interoperability.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/compare/master...BenWestgate:bips:codex32 \n<https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/compare/master...BenWestgate:bips:codex32?utm_source=chatgpt.com>\n\nFeedback is welcome.\nBest regards,\nBen Westgate\n\n-- \nYou received this message bec",

It's intended as an enum, although I don't see \"cl\" in \nBIP-93, the same way I see \"ms\"?\n\nIs there anything we can do to simplify or clarify the derivation paths? \nThey are not \"wrong\" per se but these will be the longest derivation paths \nin the BIP-85 spec and I'm wondering if there's room for \"less is more\" in \nthe derivation path.\n\n> Pseudocode: character_value = int.from_bytes(drng.read(1), \"big\") >> 3\n\nThis is sensible with respect to deriving a single bech32 character but \nhere and in the description above the number of characters we are drawing \ncould be clarified consistent with the \"Bytes Length Table\" and there also \nit should be clarified if this is bytes drawn or bytes retained or \nsomething else. It could further be clarified that all draws are from the \nsame DRNG instance. For example, elsewhere in BIP-85 we pass the .read \n*method* (not an invocation) since in RSA key gen the number of draws is \nunknown ahead of time. In your case the number of draws is known but again \nthe pseudocode should clarify how many draws or iterations to obtain a \ncomplete share or secret as a function of the derivation path segments.\n\nDrawing and truncating a single byte per character is certainly clear to \nunderstand but I keep wondering if implementers shouldn't draw ((chars * 5) \n// 8) bytes in one shot? These bytes aren't expensive or anything but it's \nless iterations, less total reads, etc. If my suggestion becomes hard to \nread or write then feel free to keep as is.\n\nOn Thursday, September 4, 2025 at 9:50:57 AM UTC-7 Ben Westgate wrote:\n\n> Thanks Javier for confirming my updates address your concerns,\n> Andrew Poelstra and Russell O'Connor gave feedback on the bip85 codex32 \n> application, they:\n> - support it for recoverable \"uncle-Jim\"-style child codex32 strings for \n> forgetful relatives.\n> - prefer wallets gener",

But to date integration\nwith Bitcoin has been scant.\n\nTo resolve that issue, Blockchain Commons has been working on demos that\nintegrate the ZF FROST library with BDK, to demonstrate how to sign Bitcoin\nPSBTs with FROST, including support for the Taproot tweak.\n\nHere's the two demos that we recently produced:\n\n* TRUSTED DEALER:\n    * Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8csdApREJIs\n    * Code Walkthrough: https://hackmd.io/y6EYPYR0SluE0M0az7Y3uw\n    * Notes: https://hackmd.io/@bc-community/H1MfEMdvel\n\n* DISTRIBUTED KEY GENERATION:\n    * Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13skzOvWklk\n    * Code Walkthrough: https://hackmd.io/cI9OVAbzSDemrcvsf9t0ag\n\nOur goal this year is a \"Learning FROST from the Command Line\" to\nsupplement our popular \"Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line\" tutorial:\nhttps://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line\n\nThe first demo was held in conjunction with our newest FROST meeting. It\nwas our fifth to date. At each, we've gathered together implementers and\ndevelopers, to help make FROST usage into a reality.\n\nOur full list of major FROST meetings is here:\nhttps://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/#events\n\nWe'll be holding one or two more this fall! If you've got a FROST-related\nproject or FROST-related code you'd like to demo, let me know and I'm\nthrilled to get you on board for a presentation!\n\nMany thanks to Human Rights Foundation and our other sustaining sponsors\nsuch as Foundation Devices, Unchained Capital; and individual monthly\nsponsors like Jesse Posner, Brian Bishop, Jameson Lopp, Glenn Willen for\nsupporting this work.\n\nIf you are interested in supporting us use\nhttps://",

Alongside introspection enabling op\ncodes, this enables the creation of a new flavor of on-chain state machine\nwithin Bitcoin Script. The set of op codes is also generic enough to enable\nseveral other use cases related to (optimized DLCs, partial musig2 signature\nverification, EC based sigma protocols, etc).\n\nA total of 4 op codes are proposed (each allocated from the existing\nOP_SUCCESS) range:\n  * `OP_EC_POINT_ADD`\n  * `OP_EC_POINT_MUL`\n  * `OP_EC_POINT_NEGATE`\n  * `OP_EC_POINT_X_COORD`\n\nThe full BIP text can be found here:\n * https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1945\n\nA reference implementation in `btcd` can be found here:\n  * https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/pull/2413\n\n--Laolu\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/CAO3Pvs-Cwj%3D5vJgBfDqZGtvmoYPMrpKYFAYHRb_EqJ5i0PG0cA%40mail.gmail.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #2: Type: text/html, Size: 1887 bytes --]",

If P2PK spends are limited to 1 per\nblock, it is possible we will see potential bidding wars for these\ntransactions at the fee level-- distributing some of the funds accrued\nthrough quantum retrieval to miners in the form of high fees.\n\nI have some good news: it can be done without any soft-forks, if needed. If\nthe main goal is to restrict spendability of coins, by relying on Proof of\nWork, then it can be done, by using OP_SIZE on DER signatures, and\ncombining it with OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY or OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, as\nproposed by ertil here:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5551080.msg65724436#msg65724436\n\nThe simplest Script has this form, and can be used inside P2WSH:\n\nOP_SIZE OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG\n\nThen, everything is timelocked to at least 9 blocks, if secp256k1 and\nSHA-256 is fully broken, but it depends mainly on the size of the\nsignature, and more realistic sizes are something around 70 bytes (or\naround 60 bytes, if someone wants to use half of the generator as R-value;\nsome miners can do that, if they can be sure, that nobody will reorg their\nblocks, and if they are not worried about revealing their keys for some\naddresses). The granularity can be increased, for example by a factor of\nfour, like it was in Signet faucet:\nhttps://delvingbitcoin.org/t/proof-of-work-based-signet-faucet/937\n\nOP_SIZE OP_DUP OP_ADD OP_DUP OP_ADD OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <pubkey>\nOP_CHECKSIG\n\nThen, realistically, things can be timelocked to something like 70*4=280\nblocks, and users can decrease it by four blocks for each grinded byte in a\ngiven signature. If private key for every secp256k1 point is known, the\nsize of the signature will decrease to something like 40 bytes, so things\nwill be still timelocked to something around 160 blocks, and will still\nrequire SHA-256 grinding, to move coi",

          "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nWanted to share our recent work on \"Glock\" (Garbled Locks) for optimistic smart contract verification on bitcoin. This is pretty similar in concept to Jeremy Rubin's work on Delbrag [0] and Robin Linus' work on BitVM3(RSA/s) [1,2], but uses different techniques to make a practical scheme. We have (linked below) a preprint that describes the scheme in detail and a research implementation under active development. We've been working on this for a long time, and I think some of techniques might be of independent interest.\n\nA \"Glock\" is a protocol for optimistic smart contract verification using Garbled Circuits. The \"Garbler\" signs the input (and proof) using a kind of Lamport-like signature and then the \"Evaluator\" can derive a secret if the smart contract fails, which they can use to sign a slashing transaction. This works with bitcoin today with no soft forks and is nice because it moves essentially all of the cost and complexity of verification off chain.\n\nIn theory, the fraud proof can literally be a Schnorr signature. Previous constructions either used something like Rubin's Grug tehcnique, which requires a larger slashing script, or had impractical costs for garbling. We propose the first (imo) practical Glock whose fraud proof is a single signature, which represents over a 550x reduction [4] of on-chain data compared to BitVM2 [3].\n\nOur protocol, Glock25, uses a bunch of interesting cryptography to make all the costs of the scheme manageable. We propose a new SNARK, which is currently the smallest known SNARK, make it designated verifier, and instantiate it with binary elliptic curves. These curves have some really nice synergies with the GC scheme. We also have some neat tricks to use adaptor signatures and verifiable secret sharing for efficient malicious security.\n\nPaper here:\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1485\n\nCode here:\n* Rust implementation of DV-Pari: github.com/alpenlabs/dv-pari\n* Binary circuit generator for DV-Pari: github.com/alpenlabs",

You are correct that the high-level goal of \nachieving quantum resilience is shared between our proposal and the earlier \none from Lopp et al. (co-authored by the Pauli Group). However, the \ncritical differentiator lies not in the \"what\" but in the \"when\" and the \n\"why\"—factors that fundamentally impact Bitcoin's security and stability.\n\nThe primary shortcoming of the Pauli Group proposal is its alarmist and \ncommercially motivated urgency, which pushes for an accelerated timeline \nthat is misaligned with the cautious, evidence-based approach of \ninternational standards bodies. As the NIST Internal Report 8547 makes \nclear, the transition to PQC is a massive undertaking that requires careful \ncoordination across the entire cryptographic ecosystem, with a realistic \ntarget for completion set for 2035 [NIST.IR.8547.ipd, p.8, 18]. NIST \nexplicitly allows for the continued use of classical signatures for \nauthentication until quantum computers are actually available, advocating \nfor a managed transition that minimizes disruption [NIST.IR.8547.ipd, p.15].\n\nThe Pauli Group's timeline seems designed to create a false sense of \nemergency, likely to benefit their commercial interests in promoting \nspecific solutions. In contrast, our BIP is structured around NIST's \nwell-reasoned 2035 horizon. This provides the entire Bitcoin \necosystem—miners, wallet providers, exchanges, and users—with a realistic \nand achievable schedule for a complete and secure migration. It avoids the \nextreme risks of a rushed implementation, which could lead to critical \nvulnerabilities, and instead fosters a deliberate, stable, and globally \ncoordinated upgrade. Our proposal is not a duplicate; it is a necessary \ncorrection towards a timeline that prioritizes Bitcoin's long-term \ncryptographic integrity over the speculative urgency of a private entity.\n\n\n*Response to ArmchairCryptologist:",

Let them compete: if Apple decides \nto incorporate compatibility whit secp256k1, it will gain a competitive \nadvantage over Samsung (and vice versa), and if bitcoinization expands on a \nlarge scale, that advantage could become very significant. If the market \nperceives value in these functionalities, companies will be motivated to \nimplement them.\n\nAdding to Greg Tonoski´s point, Samsung demonstrated that the \"mobile HSM + \nsecp256k1\" approach is technically viable (its Blockchain Keystore/SDK \nexposes APIs capable of producing ECDSA/secp256k1 signatures on selected \nGalaxy devices). While the solution ended up fragmented by model/region and \ndependent on the vendor, there was concrete development.\n\nAlso, let's remember that Bitcoin is an open and permeable organization: \nanyone or any entity can add value, whether through software \nimplementations, specification development, or tool creation. When \ninterests and goals align, those contributions get integrated and \nmanufacturers to experiment with practical, real-world solutions before \nforcing consensus changes, wich tend to be lengthy, complex, and risky.\n\nBest regards,\nJavier Mateos\n\nEl viernes, 8 de agosto de 2025 a las 23:06:29 UTC-3, Josh Doman escribió:\n\n> Hi conduition, thanks for the thoughtful reply.

There are many controversial\naspects to this debate, including whether or not quantum computers will\never actually become a practical threat.\n\nI won't tread into the unanswerable question of how worried we should be\nabout quantum computers. I think it's far from a crisis, but given the\ndifficulty in changing Bitcoin it's worth starting to seriously discuss.\nToday I wish to focus on a philosophical quandary related to one of the\ndecisions that would need to be made if and when we implement a quantum\nsafe signature scheme.\n\nSeveral Scenarios\nBecause this essay will reference game theory a fair amount, and there are\nmany variables at play that could change the nature of the game, I think\nit's important to clarify the possible scenarios up front.\n\n1. Quantum computing never materializes, never becomes a threat, and thus\neverything discussed in this essay is moot.\n2. A quantum computing threat materializes suddenly and Bitcoin does not\nhave quantum safe signatures as part of the protocol. In this scenario it\nwould likely make the points below moot because Bitcoin would be\nfundamentally broken and it would take far too long to upgrade the\nprotocol, wallet software, and migrate user funds in order to restore\nconfidence in the network.\n3. Quantum computing advances slowly enough that we come to consensus about\nhow to upgrade Bitcoin and post quantum security has been minimally adopted\nby the time an attacker appears.\n4. Quantum computing advances slowly enough that we come to consensus about\nhow to upgrade Bitcoin and post quantum security has been highly adopted by\nthe time an attacker appears.\n\nFor the purposes of this post, I'm envisioning being in situation 3 or 4.\n\nTo Freeze or not to Freeze?\nI've started seeing more people weighing in on what is likely the most\ncontentious aspect of how a quantum resistance upgrade should be handled in\nterms of migrating user funds.",
