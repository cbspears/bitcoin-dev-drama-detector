I'm consistently seeing unconfirmed transactions from months ago being rebroadcast and (now that the mempool is draining) eventually confirming, without anyone even trying to exploit anything. So from what I can tell, the only thing this really accomplishes is wasting CPU cycles and bandwidth evicting and later re-accepting the transactions in question.\n\nAll it would take is one person running a rebroadcasting service to make\nmempool eviction useless except in the rare case that a soft-fork of\nstandard transactions has happened.

The prior times that I \ninvestigated this claim, transactions with feerates lower than \n`minTxRelayFee` exclusively appeared at the front of the block, \nindicating that they were explicitly prioritized by the miner, probably \ndue to out-of-band payment. You may now also find some TRUC transactions \nwhere a low-feerate parent is carried by a higher feerate child. Neither \nof these two indicates that a miner has configured a lower `-blockmintxfee`.\nYou could convince me that a miner has configured a lower \n`-blockmintxfee` by showing us a block that includes transactions with \nfeerates below `minTxRelayFee` appearing in the organic descending \nfeerate order.\n\nOn 2025-01-31 08:43, Greg Tonoski wrote:\n > I can't see how minrelaytxfee=0.00000001 could increase risk of DoS\n > attack or make it significantly cheaper or more effective.

OP_TX and OP_TXHASH/VERIFY are examples\nhow developers sought to overcome certain pain points. However they expand\nthe scope considerably and also rely on 64 bit integer arithmetic to handle\namounts. Here we aim to show and alternative approach that covers a lot of\nuseful ground in the in-between without state-carrying covenants or general\ndetailed introspection.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/moonsettler/d2369e043473c42ff7fa52878dd064a5\n\n## CTV++\n\nTwo additional opcodes to consider as an addition to `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY`:\n\n* OP_TEMPLATEHASH\n* OP_INPUTAMOUNTS\n\nTogether they relax the strict limitations that `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY`\nimposes, because it explicitly commits to the output amounts and therefore\nimplicitly commits to the spendable input amounts in a lot of cases.\n\n### OP_TEMPLATEHASH\n\nBuilds the CTV template hash from the stack.\n\n```\n<inputIndex>\n# FOR i = inputCount-1; i >= 0; i--; LOOP\n  <sequence[i]>\n# END LOOP\n<inputCount>\n<nLockTime>\n# FOR j = outputCount-1; j >= 0; j--; LOOP\n  <out[j].amount>\n  <out[j].script>\n# END LOOP\n<outputCount>\n<nVersion>\nOP_TEMPLATEHASH\nOP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY\n```\n\n### OP_INPUTAMOUNTS\nTaproot only. Consumes a 32 bit signed integer `n` as parameter\n* `n = 0` return the SUM of all input amounts with same script\n* `n < 0` return the SUM of last abs(n) input amounts including current input\n* `n > 0` return the SUM of first n input amounts of the transaction\n\nfails if\n* `n < 0` and `abs(n) > inputIndex + 1`\n* `n > inputCount`\n\n```\n<n>\nOP_INPUTAMOUNTS\n```\n\n#### Example use:\n\nThis contract below allows the comining of UTXOs locked by the same script for\nsomething like a withdrawal from a Vault contract to a staging address where\nthe relative time lock can begin. It works with any amount UTXOs unlike basic\nCTV Vaults. Also allows for paying fees endogenously and registering a change\naddress. The fee paying input would ",

Tweak it, or use a new random \nkey. This is a non-issue\n\nThis is an issue at present. I hope you fix it as you seem to be \n[involved][1] in cashu development. The workarounds that you suggested will \nstill allow a **specific** key to be censored.\n\n>  As for authentication systems, yes of course KYC-backed authentication \nwould allow censorship, but that is an optional spec which mints aren't \ncompelled to implement or use, even once the spec is finished. AFAIK no \nmint implementations have this system in code yet, so it's not even a \nfeature at this point: just a proposed NUT document, sitting in draft \nstatus. Your assertion that \"none of the ecash implementation are \ncensorship resistant\" is a blatantly false statement bereft of fact or \ndepth.\n\nBeing optional does not matter. It is **possible** for a mint to use \nauthentication which is the whole point of this mailing list post. It is \ntrue that none of the ecash implementations are censorship resistant. Just \nbecause censorship isn't implemented yet by mints does not mean the \nprotocol is censorship resistant.\n\nThe false statements exist in cashu docs with misleading things about \ncensorship resistance.\n\n>  At worst they might lose the money they already stored with the \ncompromised mint, which is always a risk to keep in mind with ecash.\n\nThis is already described in my post.\n\n>  So ecash devs have proposed standardized auth systems which would give \nmint runners the *option* of knuckling under to KYC. I agree it would suck \nto be put to that choice, but giving them the freedom to choose is \nimportant and valid, and in no way compromises the integrity of other \nnon-KYC mints who perhaps operate freely in more enlightened jurisdictions. \n\nStandardizing KYC in the protocol is the opposite of freedom and privacy. \nJurisdict",

With the\nrapid advancement in quantum computing, this proposal outlines the\nintegration of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (SPHINCS+ and\nDilithium) to safeguard Bitcoin’s long-term security.\n\nThe key points of the proposal are:\n- Introduction of quantum-resistant signature algorithms (SPHINCS+ and\nDilithium).\n- New Bech32-based address formats for quantum-resistant addresses.\n- Modifications to transaction structures and script opcodes to support\nlarger signature sizes.\n- A transition mechanism through a soft fork to ensure backward\ncompatibility with existing Bitcoin addresses and transactions.\n\nThe full BIP draft is available here\nhttps://github.com/chucrut/bips/blob/master/bip-xxxx.md for your review and\nfeedback. I look forward to the community's input and am open to\nsuggestions on how to improve the proposal.\n\nBest regards,\nAgustín Cruz\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bitcoin Development Mailing List\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to bitcoindev+unsubscribe@googlegroups•com.\nTo view this discussion on the web visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/CAJDmzYyPJSgHvg57OcQoBN9JWs-eGxLSwm%2BRc66HoaRqhTq3_A%40mail.gmail.com.\n\n[-- Attachment #2: Type: text/html, Size: 1969 bytes --]",

There was a \nsimilar concern over RSA about 25 years ago, and the question of the \nexponent related to the operation as a matter of security. They weren't \nsure if the exponent should be high, random or irrelevant to the security. \nTurns out that it was irrelevant, so the cryptography community relaxed and \nselected the exponent 3 for RSA for performance reasons with no cost to \nsecurity. When a parameter is so relevant to the security of FALCON it is \nalarming, and the algorithm may be unsuitable for blockchain. \n\nI would suggest NTRU Prime by Daniel Bernstein as a solid contender for \nsecure Lattice. Critically to a heterogenous environment, it is not \nsusceptible to side channel attacks so the keys cannot be stolen through \nmagnets next to a thumb drive. Daniel Bernstein managed to perform side \nchannel attacks 10 out of 10 times on multiple NIST PQ standards.\n\nA quantum network runs 45x faster than the same qubits assigned to a single \nmachine. https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15465\nQuantum networks also require less wiring, and a 6000 node network of 1152 \nqubit machines can crack bitcoin in 10 minutes on \naverage. https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08585 The qubit count is expected to go \ndown by at least 30% by 2027 due to general improvement in the algorithm. \nLitinski explained his algorithm at Crypto conference, and included further \noptimizations to lower the qubit count and increase \nperformance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AumHpDRS5iI\n\nThe scaling of some machines and algorithms is indeed \nlinear https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02892 but this is not always true.

Checking all tx sizes is far more overhead than \nvalidating the coinbase for a null point. As AntoineP agreed, it cannot be \ndone earlier, and I have shown that it is *significantly* more \ncomputationally intensive. It makes the determination much more costly and \nin all other cases by adding an additional check that serves no purpose.\n\nI think for any (new) consensus rule, we shall be able to evalute its \nimplication in term of at least 2 dimensions a) memory overhead (e.g do a \nfull-node needs more memory to validate post-segwit blocks now that witness \nfields are discounted ?) and b) computational overhead (e.g do a full-node \nneeds more CPU cycles to validate confidential transactions perdersen \ncommitments ?). A same consensus rule can achieve the same effect e.g \nreducing headers merkle tree ambiguities, with completely different memory \nor computational cost. For the checking all tx sizes vs validating the \ncoinbase for a null point, indeed I agree with you that the latter is \nintuitively better on the 2 dimensions.\n\n> I think you misunderstood me. Of course the witness commitment must be \nvalidated (as I said, \"Yet it remains necessary to validate the witness \ncommitment...\"), as otherwise the witnesses within a block can be anything \nwithout affecting the block hash. And of course the witness commitment is \ncomputed in the same manner as the tx commitment and is therefore subject \nto the same malleations. However, because the coinbase tx is committed to \nthe block hash, there is no need to guard the witness commitment for \nmalleation. And to my knowled",

While creating these covenants is as easy as\ncreating a transaction with P2WSH output, spending these covenants\nrequires substantial computation and involves creating very large\nbitcoin transactions.\n\nSpending such a covenant requires ~2^86 hash calls to SHA-1 and\nRIPEMD-160.  In comparison, mining a Bitcoin block at current\ndifficulty requires ~2^78.3 hash calls to SHA256x2. Thus, spending\nsuch a covenant would require the same number of hash queries the\nentire Bitcoin network does in roughly ~33 hours. Such covenants could\nbe created today, but spending them likely requires the creation of\ndedicated ASICs.\n\nWhile the computational costs limit the immediate applicability of our\ncovenants, we are optimistic that future work can significantly\nimprove these numbers. This approach is not a replacement for a\ncovenant opcode because:\n1. High computational cost: Our approach is likely to be many orders\nof magnitude more computationally expensive than a covenant opcode.\n2. 4Mb transactions: Transaction size, computation cost trade-off\nexists that reduces the computational costs of these covenants by\nincreasing the transaction size. Due to most of the cost being\ncomputational it is likely they always be just under 4MB in size even\nwith efficiency gain. 4MB is the limit for valid transactions.\n\nOur approach is framed around covenants, but our approach enables\narbitrary computation on Bitcoin transaction data. This arbitrary\ncomputation is bounded only by the circuit size we can pack into what\nis left of a 4Mb Bitcoin transaction after it contains all our\nnecessary machinery. This means, for example, we can do Tapscript\nlamport signatures that sign the sighash of the spending transaction.\n\nOne of the auth",

A covenant is a set of rules about what transactions can\nspend a Bitcoin output which is encumbered by that covenant. Typically\na covenant is enforced by preventing someone from spending that\noutput. In this protocol we instead allow the spending of the output\nand then punish the spender by a loss of funds, i.e. we slash them, if\nthey do not follow the rules of the covenant. This is less secure than\na covenant enforced by an opcode, FE or ColliderScript, because it\nrelies on incentives over enforcement. The advantage of this approach\nis that it is efficient, does not add new cryptographic assumptions\nand is possible on Bitcoin today.\n\nThis protocol uses very similar mechanisms to BitVM, originally I\nthought this was how BitVM worked, which is why I didn’t publish it.\nAfter talking to many people it appears this technique is not used in\nBitVM.\n\n\nNotation\n====\nBy <x>32 we denote a value, x, in Bitcoin Script which is encoded as a\nlist of 32-bit stack elements. We can perform arbitrary computation on\nsuch values using Bitcoin’s math opcodes, a.k.a., Small Script.\n\nProtocol\n====\nThe essential problem for enforcing covenants in Bitcoin outputs is\nshowing that a signature s1 that will pass CHECKSIGVERIFY is equal to\na signature s2 encoded for Small Script. This is because once we get a\nsignature into Small Script, we extract the sighash and do transaction\nintrospection. ColliderScript gets us covenants by using hash\ncollisions to check equality between s1 and <s2>32. CAT gets us\ncovenants by simply concatenating all the <s2>32 and then comparing\nagainst s1 using EQUAL:\n\ns2 = CAT(<s2>32 [0], <s2>32 [1],  <s2>32 [2], … <s2>32 [15])\nEQUAL s1, s2\n\nSlashing covenants works by removing the requirement for this equality\ncheck, but instead providing a fraud proof ifs1!=s2, and posting that\nfraud proof to punish the spending party.

          "body": "[-- Attachment #1: Type: text/plain, Size: 2990 bytes --]\n\nHi everyone,\n\nAs part of my investigation in the Consensus Cleanup proposal [0] i suggested we include a fix for potential duplicate coinbase transactions in the future. This would avoid having to re-enable BIP30 verification after block height 1,983,702.\n\nThere are different ways this can be fixed. I am sending this email to reach out to engineers and stakeholders of the mining industry, to learn if some ways of fixing this would make things easier for them than others.\n\nThe root issue we are trying to solve is: BIP34 mandated that the block height be committed to by the coinbase transaction as the first element of the scriptSig. However some coinbase transactions which predate BIP34 activation commit to some future height. This leaves a possibility for duplicating the coinbase at these heights, which is why BIP30 validation will need to be resumed in Bitcoin full nodes. See this comment [1] in the Bitcoin Core source code for more detail about this. See this post [2] in my Consensus Cleanup thread for a list of all heights inferior to 10,000,000 that were committed in early coinbase transactions.\n\nAn additional motivation for this is that Utreexo nodes cannot perform BIP30 validation [3].\n\nThe fix is simply to mandate that each future coinbase transaction whose height was committed differs in some way from the early coinbase transaction that committed to its height. Here is some ways to achieve this:\n\n- require that future coinbase transactions commit to their height minus one in the nLocktime​ field;\n- require that future coinbase transactions commit to their height in the nLockTime​ field and also set their nSequence​ to the maximum value (to disable the timelock);\n- require that future coinbase transactions have a nVersion​ different than 1​;\n- require the witness commitment to always be present, even for blocks with no segwit transaction.\n\nIs any of these preferable? Why? Would any of these make miners",

If we already had CAT or had\nreasonable assurances that CAT will be activated soon, the balance of tradeoffs\nmight have tipped against a late introduction of a new opcode to a concept that\nwas already floating out there.\n\nQ: What is the difference between PAIRCOMMIT and CAT?\n\nA: PAIRCOMMIT is domain separated from other implicit uses of hashing pieces of\ndata together. CAT allows for reconstructing and therefore inspecting sighashes\non the stack. And not only it allows for fine grained introspection, it also\nallows for inspecting ancestor transactions. This makes CAT with the Poelstra\ntrick a way to implement state carrying covenants.\n* If CAT has consensus, PAIRCOMMIT is an optimization of which we already have\nplenty examples of in script\n* If CAT has no consensus, PAIRCOMMIT gets the job done in regards to a veryspecific subset of behaviors, that explicitly do not include introspection.\n\nBR.\nmoonsettler\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n<pre>\n\nBIP: ?\n\nLayer: Consensus (soft fork)\n\nTitle: OP_PAIRCOMMIT\n\nAuthor: moonsettler <\n\nmoonsettler@protonmail•com\n\n>\n\nComments-Summary: No comm",

          "body": "Hi,\n\nlists.linuxfoundation.org is no longer hosting the static HTML email\narchives for bitcoin-dev or any other mailing list. We knew that this\nmight happen and prepared months ago with the mailing list migration\nand also with various backups:\nhttps://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CABaSBaxDjj6ySBx4v+rmpfrw4pE9b=JZJPzPQj_ZUiBg1HGFyA@mail.gmail.com/\n\nHowever, many thousands of links around the web are still pointing to\nthe old archive. This is really unfortunate as there is a wealth of\ncontent in the archive and these links were considered canonical. This\nis a general plea to update any broken links that you might be able to\nfix.\n\nWhat you can do, options\n========================\n\nThere are a few options for actions that effected content providers can take:\n\n1) Use `gnusha.org/url`. Explained below.\n\n2) Replace lists.linuxfoundation.org urls with resolved urls to a new\nlocation for mailing list archives. More on this below.\n\n3) Do nothing. Wait and see. It is possible that we can plead our case\nto Linux Foundation and get them to host static archives indefinitely,\nor at least host redirects.\n\n4) Replace broken links with Wayback Machine urls. Someone told me\napparently their archive is incomplete? I don't recommend this one\nbecause I am concerned about stress and strain on the Internet Archive\nWayback Machine service beyond the additional activity that these\nlinks would incur. Besides, Wayback is already a highly centralized\npoint for internet archival activity and therefore some\ndecenteralization is warranted here.\n\n\ngnusha.org/url redirect service\n===============================\n\nThis is a redirect service I made that takes a URL parameter and\nredirects. To use it, get a previous url like:\n\n`https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-June/014472.html`\n\nyour new url will be:\n\n`https://gnusha.org/url/https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-June/014472.html`\n\nand it will redirect to a current mailing list archive location for\nthat mess",

          "body": "Quick update on this. There was various pushback on the idea of updating a \"Final\" BIP, so instead \nthis is gonna be a new BIP.\n\nSince its a new BIP we have the opportunity to add a bit more, so I went ahead and added a \"payment \ninfo callback\" parameter. Like the original proposed change this doesn't impact any existing \nwallets, but it does provide a new (important) feature for some use-cases, especially things like \nnostr zaps. The same PR is still where the new BIP lives, and there's examples and rationale, but to \nhiglight the new (normative) section, it is included below:\n\n=== Proof of Payment ===\n\nThe URI MAY include a \"pop\" (or \"req-pop\") parameter whose value can be used to build a URI which \nthe wallet application can, after payment completes, \"open\" to provide proof the payment was \ncompleted or other information about the payment.\n\nThe value of a \"pop\" (or \"req-pop\") parameter shall be a percent-encoded (per RFC 3986 section 2.1) \nURI prefix. The wallet application, if it supports providing payment information SHOULD \npercent-decode the provided URI once, append the query parameter key from which the payment \ninstructions used were read, append a single =, and finally append the Payment Information to the \nresulting URI and open it with the default system handler for the URI. For payment instructions read \nfrom the body of the URI, \"onchain\" SHALL be used in place of the key.\n\nA wallet MUST validate that the provided URI's scheme is not (case-insensitive) \"http\", \"https\", \n\"file\", \"javascript\", \"mailto\" or any other scheme which will open in a web browser prior to opening it.\n\nIf a wallet will not open the pop scheme (either because it does not support returning payment \ninformation for the selected payment method or because it uses a URI scheme which should not be \nopened) and the parameter was passed as a \"req-pop\" parameter, the wallet MUST NOT initiate payment.\n\nFor payments made using an on-chain transaction, the Payment Information shall be the ful",
