      "body": "This tries to fix #34205\r\n\r\nI stared at the test code quite a bit and initially suspected some `MiniWallet` internals to be the issue but I think that was the wrong direction and there is simply a very small chance that the loop in `test_sequence_lock_confirmed_inputs` runs out of available utxos: We are starting out with 200-250 utxos and run the loop 400 times. If a transaction is accepted it could have up to 10 inputs but it always has only one output, so the pool is depleting in this case. And it's actually even worse because the output produced is not recognized as spendable by the `MiniWallet` because it is not using the correct output script. However, only a small fraction of transactions are actually accepted, which is why this issue almost never occurs. I did some extra printing and usually we end up with >100 utxos still available by the end of the test. But there is a small chance that too many transactions are accepted and then we can run out of utxos.\r\n\r\nI considered two fixes: The first was a break at the beginning of the loop `if available_utxos == 0: break`, this would work fine but I went with the second option: Simply creating the output with the correct output script so that `MiniWallet` recognizes it as spendable. This minimal replentishment of available utxos ensures that at worst we should get a few 1 input, 1 ouput transactions by the end but we should never run out of available utxos. I didn't look back in history but I suspect that this is how it was intended before `MiniWallet` introduced.\r\n\r\nAlso moves the `random` import in the same function to the top of the file.",

It is the first six commits of #32061 and provides a string-parsing utility (`LineReader`) that is also consumed by #34158.\r\n\r\nThese are the functions that are added / updated for HTTP and Torcontrol:\r\n\r\n- `GetBindAddress()`: Given a socket, provides the bound address as a CService. Currently used by p2p but moved from `net` to `netbase` so other modules can call it.\r\n- `ToIntegral()`: Already used to parse numbers from strings, added new argument `base = 10` so it can also be used to parse hexadecimal integers. HTTP chunked transfer-encoding uses hex-encoded integers to specify payload size: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230.html#section-4.1\r\n- `AsciiCaseInsensitive` comparators: Needed to store HTTP headers in an `unordered_map`. Headers are key-value pairs that are parsed with case-insensitive keys: https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#rfc.section.5.1\r\n- `FormatRFC1123DateTime()`: The required datetime format for HTTP headers (e.g. `Fri, 31 May 2024 19:18:04 GMT`)\r\n- `LineReader`: Fields in HTTP requests are newline-terminated. This struct is given an input buffer and provides methods to read lines as strings.\r\n",
