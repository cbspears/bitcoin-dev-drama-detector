      "title": "Failure to bind to ZMQ addresses is swallowed in debug logs",
      "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nWhen failing to bind to specified ZMQ addresses due to them already being in use, the error is completely swallowed up when not running with debug logs. \n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI'd expect one of two things to happen:\n\n1. Bitcoin Core exiting with a non-zero status code and a clear message saying what happened (I'd prefer this)\n2. An error message in the logs, that is visible without having to enable debug logs. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Spawn a node with one of the ZMQ arguments provided: `bitcoind -regtest -noconf -datadir=(mktemp -d) -rpcuser=user -rpcpassword=password -rpcport=18888 -port=17777 -zmqpubrawblock=tcp://localhost:10000`\n2. Spawn a second node with the same ZMQ argument(s): `bitcoind -regtest -noconf -datadir=(mktemp -d) -rpcuser=user -rpcpassword=password -rpcport=18889 -port=17778 -zmqpubrawblock=tcp://localhost:10000`\n3. Observe that both nodes run just fine, but that just the first one is able to bind to the ZMQ address:\n   ```\n   ❯ bitcoin-cli -rpcport=18888 -rpcuser=user -rpcpassword=password getzmqnotifications\n   [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"pubrawblock\",\n        \"address\": \"tcp://localhost:10000\",\n        \"hwm\": 1000\n      }\n    ]\n\n    ❯ bitcoin-cli -rpcport=18889 -rpcuser=user -rpcpassword=password getzmqnotifications\n    [\n    ]\n    ```\n4. Observe that no clear warnings/errors are produced from the second node. \n\n### Relevant log output\n\n<details>\n\n❯ bitcoind -regtest -noconf -datadir=(mktemp -d) -rpcuser=user -rpcpassword=password -rpcport=18889 -port=17778 -zmqpubrawblock=tcp://localhost:10000\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Bitcoin Core version v29.0.0 (release build)\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Using the 'arm_shani(1way,2way)' SHA256 implementation\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Default data directory /Users/torkel/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Using data directory /var/folders/91/w34lrpx12hl46htkt8l7ntph0000gn/T/tmp.0w5H0uf0Uy/regtest\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Config file: <disabled>\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Command-line arg: conf=false\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Command-line arg: datadir=\"/var/folders/91/w34lrpx12hl46htkt8l7ntph0000gn/T/tmp.0w5H0uf0Uy\"\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Command-line arg: port=\"17778\"\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Command-line arg: regtest=\"\"\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Command-line arg: rpcpassword=****\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Command-line arg: rpcport=\"18889\"\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Command-line arg: rpcuser=****\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Command-line arg: zmqpubrawblock=\"tcp://localhost:10000\"\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Using at most 125 automatic connections (285 file descriptors available)\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z scheduler thread start\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Binding RPC on address ::1 port 18889\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Binding RPC on address 127.0.0.1 port 18889\n2025-10-27T17:10:29Z Config options rpcuser and rpcpassword will soon be deprecated.

      "title": "Bitcoin <> Grin Atomic swaps to bypass censorship, Core-Knots Node debate",
      "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nIntegrate Mimblewimble (MW) as a consensus-friendly sidechain ([Grin](https://docs.grin.mw/wiki/introduction/grin-for-bitcoiners/)) or covenant-based extension to Bitcoin to enhance its long-term privacy, fungibility, and scalability. This would provide a trustless, cryptographic safeguard against the systemic risks of transactional surveillance, chain analysis, and the increasing centralization of mining and node operation.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n Bitcoin faces several emergent systemic risks that threaten its core value propositions of censorship-resistance and decentralization:\n\n1. **Erosion of Fungibility and Privacy**: The transparent nature of the blockchain allows for sophisticated chain analysis. This enables third parties (governments, exchanges) to blacklist or devalue coins based on their transaction history, fundamentally undermining Bitcoin's role as a neutral  P2P medium of exchange.\n2. **Centralizing Pressures:** The resource intensity of running a full node and the capital requirements for mining are creating centralizing pressures. This is compounded by regulatory efforts to impose KYC/AML on node operatrs and miners, creating potential single points of failure for censorship.\n3. **Scalability and Network Effects:** A perpetually growing blockchain creates a high barrier to entry for individual node operators, reducing network decentralization. Furthermore, if large institutions and _governments hoard coins without spending them_, the network's utility as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system diminishes and network stalls.\n4. **Censorship Resistance**: _The current debate **CORE V30 vs Knots deabte_** showd that the current system is vulnerable to regulatory pressure on miners and nodes to censor transactions.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe solution is to build robust, user-friendly tooling that enables seamless **atomic swaps between Bitcoin and Grin**. This would involve:\n\n**Library Developmen**t: Create and standardize _open-source libraries for Bitcoin-Grin atomic swaps_. \n\nWallet Integration: Encourage  the integration of this capability into major non-custodial Bitcoin wallets, and create synergy with GRIN developers and codebase. Grin Bitcoin fund has enough Bitcoin to fund these.\n\n**Node Compatibility**: Ensure the solution works with a standard Bitcoin Core node and a Grin node, reinforcing  people easily run own nodes. A Grin node is super lightweight, easily runs on an old mobile phne.\n\nThis approach allows users to:\n\n_Move BTC into the Mimblewimble sidechain (Grin) for private, low-fee, fungible transactions._\n\nMove value back to the **_Bitcoin blockchain when needed for settlement._**\n\n**_Enjoy enhanced privacy without changing Bitcoin's fundamental properties._**\n\n\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n1. **Using centralized mixing services or coinjoin**: These services r_equire trust_, have privacy limitations, and can be points of failure or censorship. _They do not provide the same level of cryptographic privacy guarantees as Mimblewimble_\n2. **Relying on Layer-2 solutions like Lightning**: While excellent for speed and cost, Lightning has its own _privacy trade-offs and complex  centralized trust models_ for channel management. It does not solve the base-layer _fungibility_ issue.\n3. **Do Nothing:** **_Maintaining the status quo accepts the risks of increasing regulatory capture_**, loss of **fungibility**, and **centralization**, potentially leading to a future where Bitcoin is a \"**settlement layer**\" _controlled by a few permissioned entities, thus betraying its original peer-to-peer vision_.\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n**The potential benefits of Mimblewimble integration** are;\n- **Strong Privacy & Fungibility**: _No addresses, amounts, or transactions visible on blockchain._\n- **No Metadata/Spam**: **_The blockchain does not permanently store unnecessary data, protecting nodes from CSAM and spam attacks._**\n- **Lightweight Blockchain**: The \"cut-through\" feature leads to a much smaller blockchain, making it easy for anyone to run a full node on low-power devices like old mobile phones, ensuring true decentralization.\n\nThis proposal leverages Grin's existing, live, and functional Mimblewimble blockchain, avoiding the need to build a new sidechain from scratch also.\n\n**_This is about expanding the Bitcoin ecosystem's capabilities, not replacing Bitcoin, by creating a synergistic relationship with a complementary privacy protocol._**\n\n**In the age of AI surveillance with KYC rules, this isn't a privacy feature missing; it is a fatal design necessity in its monetary function.**\n\nhttps://docs.grin.mw/wiki/introduction/grin-for-bitcoiners/\n",
