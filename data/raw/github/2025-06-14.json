      "title": "fees: prevent redundant estimates flushes",
      "body": "This PR does two things:\r\n\r\n1. It prevents redundant writes to the `fee_estimates.dat` file when there is no usable data available. For example, during IBD, blocks are still being connected, but unnecessary flushes still occur every hour.\r\n\r\n2. It updates the flushing log to use debug-level logging under the `estimatefee` category. It also ensures the log consistently includes only the full file path.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
