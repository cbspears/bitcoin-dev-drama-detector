And based on that, `NextSyncBlock()` is already doing well, so how about just tweak `if (pindex)` to `if (pindex || pindex_prev == chain.Tip())` to keep a minimum change?",

So any violation would have to directly lead to the process being killed, or otherwise logged to mark the tests as failed later on. I am not aware of a tool that allows this without host/root access, so for testing (with or without CI), you'll probably want a full vm with logging/debugging set up (via auditd, AppArmor, SELinux, firejail, strace, ...). Obviously as a user you can still use whatever sandbox you prefer, but for auditing the setup seems more involved.",

That said, spending 70 seconds on a single test per mutant is making our analysis to take a long time.",
