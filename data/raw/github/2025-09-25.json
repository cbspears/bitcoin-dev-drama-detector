      "title": "ci: Turn CentOS config into Alpine musl config",
      "body": "Fixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33437\r\n\r\nHistorically, the centos task was added to add CI coverage for old packages and 32-bit depends builds, but both are now covered by different tasks.\r\n\r\nThe CentOS task aligns with Ubuntu/Debian CI tasks in terms of libc usage, but (slightly) differs in package naming and update philosophy. I am not aware of the task ever discovering a centos-related issue, so it seems fine to recycle it into an Alpine Linux task.\r\n\r\nThe main difference would be that musl libc is now used. Also, busybox is used in Alpine, so in theory the busybox install could be removed from the arm CI task in the future.\r\n\r\nPackaging considerations: All packages should roughly be the same (gcc remains at version 14, python remains at version 3.12, etc). Also, all packages are from the Alpine main track, coming with 2 years of support. The only exception is the py3-pip package (https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=py3-pip&branch=v3.22&repo=&arch=riscv64) from the community track, however, I don't expect any issues arising from that.",
