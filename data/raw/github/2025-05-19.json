      "body": "Builds on #29868 (to have windows support).\r\n\r\nThis switches the `-*notify` options to use the subprocess library, which is currently used for only the external signer. The main advantage of this is that file descriptor leaks are avoided (#32343). This could also add future flexibility in notifications, for example to bypass the shell (and launch commands with their arguments directly[1]), or do something with command output (like log it). But for now, this is meant to be one-to-one.\r\n\r\n- Generalize `ENABLE_EXTERNAL_SIGNER` build option to `ENABLE_SUBPROCESS`.\r\n- Unify everything dealing with external commands in `common/run_command.cpp`. Use the new functions `RunShell` and `RunShellInThread`.\r\n- Remove `HAVE_SYSTEM`.\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n[1] There's a long-running issue on Windows where it can't pass the wallet name because there's no way to escape it for the shell.",

I checked through [bitcoincore.org/en/releases](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/)  and came up with this something like : https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/29.0/ .
