I think all of this sounds great, but I still haven't seen the larger picture, as the cross-tests and functional tests are left out (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33483#issuecomment-3340123470), among many other things.\r\n\r\nAgain, not a blocker for this pull, and I am happy to continue discussion elsewhere. Though, generally my thinking is that the dashboard should not discriminate against tests written in other programming languages, or even tests written outside the tree of Bitcoin Core. For example, it would be great to have a dashboard with third party integrations of Bitcoin Core to answer the long standing QA problem of us (and the third parties) not knowing when an integration is broken and if it can be fixed. (Usually the rc phase or post-final phase is too late). Also, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18816 has been waiting for years with no one to implement it, as it is not trivial 5 minute task.\r\n\r\nI am just saying this to clarify that this pull request is not the first and final step in getting a dashboard up. In fact, the benchmarks are already run through ctest, so this pull request here seems even optional on the topic of the dashboard. \r\n\r\nSo I'd love to see a larger design document around the dashboard. This may also help to get more people's wishlist items on it. (I've heard that corecheck could be fully or partially moved to the dashboard). Such a design document could help to ensure we are moving toward a shared goal (ideally with people already signed up to share the workload of moving there), instead of risking to end up with an even more fragmented CI/QA jungle.

      "body": "**Description**\r\nFrom what I deciphered reading the line https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/macdeploy/macdeployqtplus#L390 is that qt translations are optional to have hence we should be able to build without it but the case where the flag translations_dir falls back to its default Null value it raises this error.\r\n\r\nThe config comments also mentioned that adding translation file is optional.\r\n\r\n```\r\n./macdeployqtplus --help\r\nusage: macdeployqtplus [-h] [-verbose [VERBOSE]] [-no-plugins] [-no-strip] [-translations-dir path] [-zip zip] app-bundle\r\n\r\nImproved version of macdeployqt. Outputs a ready-to-deploy app in a folder \"dist\" and optionally wraps it in a .zip file. Note, that the \"dist\" folder will be deleted before deploying on each run. Optionally, Qt translation files\r\n(.qm) can be added to the bundle.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\nSo I was following the general steps to set up app on macos however I didn't download any qt translations presuming it was optional from the comment linkedin in PR, so to reproduce if you have translation directories in place ull need to delete them and then try to build the file, otherwise don't download it at all and try to build it. It should fail on that flag as translations dir was never downloaded.\r\n\r\n**Approach taken**\r\nI have moved the code which adds language files under the if statement that first checks if the value of the flag is not Null before referencing it.\r\n",
