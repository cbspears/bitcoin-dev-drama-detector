      "title": "blocks: add `-reobfuscate-blocks` argument to enable (de)obfuscating existing blocks",
      "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nRecent discussions highlighted that many nodes which synced before Bitcoin Core v28 have their block and undo files stored effectively in the clear (zero XOR key). This patch adds a simple, resumable maintenance tool to obfuscate previously raw block files, rotate an existing key to a fresh random one, or de-obfuscate (set key to zero) if consciously chosen, all without requiring resync. The operation can be cancelled and restarted safely.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nThe new startup option `-reobfuscate-blocks[=VALUE]` accepts either 16 hex characters as an exact 8-byte XOR key (little-endian in-memory layout) or a boolean to generate a random 64-bit key. e.g. `-reobfuscate-blocks=0000000000000000` sets the key to zero, effectively removing obfuscation.\r\n\r\nIf we detect unobfuscated blocks at start time we suggest this new option in a warning.\r\n\r\nAt startup, we iterate over all undo and block files (grouping the block and undo files for more uniform iteration), read them with the old XOR key and write them back with the new key (`<name>.reobfuscated`). The implementation actually combines the two keys and reads directly into the new obfuscated version to only do a single iteration over the data. This works if the original blocks aren't obfuscated or if the new blocks aren't or if both are.\r\nAfter successful write, we immediately delete the old file. Once all files are staged, we rename them back and atomically swap `xor.dat.reobfuscated` → `xor.dat` and continue operation.\r\n\r\nWe log the old and new keys and print progress roughly per-percent as files complete (i.e. max 100 progress logs).\r\n\r\n### Constraints\r\n\r\n* Re-obfuscation resumes automatically (detected via `xor.dat.reobfuscated`) even without the flag. In worst-case a crash should only force us to redo previous work.\r\n* Single-threaded, processing one file at a time to keep code simple and avoid complexity of interleaving renames and key swaps across threads.\r\n* Fast in practice with sequential read/modify/write per blockfile - after recent obfuscation vectorization, this path is very quick.\r\n\r\n### Reproducer\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncmake -B build -DENABLE_IPC=ON -DBUILD_GUI=ON\r\ncmake --build build -j$(nproc)\r\n# command line\r\n./build/bin/bitcoind -reobfuscate-blocks -stopatheight=1\r\n# same with GUI\r\n./build/bin/bitcoin-qt -reobfuscate-blocks -stopatheight=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Single-threaded Performance\r\n\r\n cpu                 | hdd/ssd | block count | size    | files  | time (min) | blocks/min \r\n---------------------|---------|-------------|---------|--------|------------|------------\r\n Apple M4 Max laptop | SSD     | ~909k       | ~707 GB | 9,982  | 8.4        | 146,613    \r\n Intel Core i9       | SSD     | ~909k       | ~725 GB | 10,238 | 23.1       | 39,351     \r\n Raspberry Pi 5      | SSD     | ~914k       | ~728 GB | 10,276 | 72.78      | 12,558     \r\n Intel Core i7       | HDD     | ~909k       | ~720 GB | 10,156 | 208.7      | 4,356      \r\n Raspberry Pi 4B     | HDD     | ~915k       | ~730 GB | 10,304 | 1467       | 624        \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSimilar work:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32451\r\n* https://github.com/andrewtoth/blocks-xor\r\n",

      "body": "## Context\nIn `policy/policy.cpp`, inside `IsStandardTx`, OP_RETURN (NULL_DATA) outputs are limited in size (`nMaxDatacarrierBytes`, default 80 bytes). This effectively prevents arbitrarily large payloads but does not fully eliminate systemic risks from structured misuse.\n\n## Description of risk\nEven within the allowed size, OP_RETURN can be systematically repurposed as a signaling channel. For example:\n- Each UTXO could embed a short marker in its OP_RETURN.\n- These markers could be aggregated and interpreted as \"votes,\" weighted by UTXO value.\n- Such schemes open the door to unintended governance mechanisms, plutocratic signaling, or coordinated coercion.\n\n## Why this matters\nBitcoin’s governance model relies on *implicit consensus* (full-node validation, miner incentives, market dynamics), not *explicit on-chain signaling*.  \nIf OP_RETURN becomes a de facto signaling layer, it could:\n- Create social pressure to treat such outputs as binding \"votes.\"\n- Enable plutocratic influence proportional to coin holdings.\n- Incentivize coordination games or mempool spam outside Bitcoin’s intended scope.\n\n## Discussion\nThere is likely no definitive technical fix: stricter byte limits or per-tx rules can be easily circumvented.  \nThe more realistic risk is narrative: if OP_RETURN signaling is tolerated or left unaddressed, it may gain unintended legitimacy over time.  \n\n---\nThis is not a bug report but a design consideration. Input from maintainers on how to frame OP_RETURN’s role to avoid misinterpretation or misuse in the near future would be appreciated.\n",

Even if you have P2PK-only, old, plain, ECDSA signatures, then still: they can commit to arbitrary data, through their R-values.\n\n> Each UTXO could embed a short marker in its OP_RETURN.\n\nNot only in OP_RETURN. Since miners started accepting out-of-band transactions, then different transaction versions can be used to signal things, just like they are used during soft-forks, to check, how many miners are ready to support some BIP.\n\n> These markers could be aggregated and interpreted as \"votes,\" weighted by UTXO value.\n\nEven if we talk about standard transactions, then still: they can be mined. And there are some altcoins, using that kind of schemes, for example: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5535410\n\nAnd then, you can see transactions like that on-chain: https://mempool.space/tx/000000000fdf0c619cd8e0d512c7e2c0da5a5808e60f12f1e0d01522d2986a51\n\n> Incentivize coordination games or mempool spam outside Bitcoin’s intended scope.\n\nFor example sidechains? See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5552091.0\n\nCoordination games were always possible, since 2009. To stop them, it would require banning OP_SIZE, and blocking all ways of mining things, including vanity addresses, and stuff like that. I think the problem mentioned in the title is unavoidable, and now, the only thing to discuss is: how to deal with it?\n\nEdit: An example of a coordination game, where OP_RETURN is not needed. You support taproot? You want to say it out loud to some old users, by using some old address type? Then you use an address like that: https://mempool.space/address/bc1qtapr00t2sfghswc4tksfh2gx0yrn8rd84qw32r\n\nAnd then, by publicly announcing some proposal, and counting all vanity addresses with a given prefix, you can use it to count support from users, and make a coordination game, where if N people (or N coins) will meet a given vanity pattern, then something can be triggered.\n\nAnother way is Proof of Work inside Script: https://mempool.space/tx/8349df0753e80cce322322f1b76789e1d0fd6693aed2f4de4e49576423081ae7\n\nYou put some challenge, like in bc1qts0jh2d2nesmketmw3thedwrx939k2tqu04gy90x9hd4049g4uhs83ltjx to produce a DER signature, which is smaller than 54 bytes. You can even add more coins in, by signing a given input, along with some additional coins, like bc1q9nw84cph4dn2pw78pnaec68c82h7pxvv55cla8 did. And then, people can send \"shares\", by meeting the challenge partially, for example by sharing 55-byte signatures, and even form \"pools\", which will move given coins in a coordinated way.\n\nAnd then, if you require Proof of Work, which is enforced by consensus rules, then behind it, you can form any other network on top of it. Then, by attacking some altcoin, you will have to directly attack Bitcoin users, by breaking into a real transaction, and finding a bug in it. And then, attacking altcoins is no longer about making some subnetwork weaker, but it is then a real attack on real Bitcoin users, which will be much harder to justify, if that idea will spread, and if next altcoin makers will use similar schemes.",

My point is not to “ban signaling” but to avoid creating a salient Schelling point that lowers coordination costs and invites misinterpretation as governance.\n\nOP_RETURN is cheap to parse, indexable, and highly visible on explorers. That visibility can turn it into a de facto focal channel, even if the same is theoretically possible elsewhere. The question is not “can people signal” but “should Core policy and surrounding UX legitimize one obvious, countable channel”",
