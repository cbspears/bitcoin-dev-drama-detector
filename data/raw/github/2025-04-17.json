This PR does make it possible to call RPC methods over a unix socket, but in order to do that you need to use capnproto which is not available everywhere. For example there wouldn't be an easy way for our python test framework to use the socket directly unless it depended on https://github.com/capnproto/pycapnp. So another solution that uses a another protocol or just uses http over the socket might be preferable to this approach. But the first commit here could be useful for supporting other approaches as well.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "I've pushed an update to check more broadly. The new issues (for just Polish) include some false positives around (change/reszta). Though, the others largely apply as far as I can see:\n\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will &lt;b&gt;LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</source>\n        <translation>hasłoOstrzeżenie: Jeśli zaszyfrujesz swój portfel i zgubisz hasło - &lt;b&gt;STRACISZ WSZYSTKIE SWOJE BITCONY&lt;/b&gt;!</translation>\nThe translation prepends \"hasło\" to the warning. While \"hasło\" means \"password\", it's an unnecessary and awkward addition to the beginning of the warning message. It doesn't change the core meaning but makes the translation read poorly and could be confusing. It's an error in translation quality.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Wallet to be encrypted</source>\n        <translation>Portfel do zaszyfrowania </translation>\nThe translation \"Portfel do zaszyfrowania\" is grammatically incorrect and sounds unnatural in Polish. A correct translation would be \"Portfel do zaszyfrowania\" or \"Zaszyfrować portfel\". The \"do\" construction is awkward here and implies encryption *for* the wallet, rather than *of* the wallet. While not malicious, it's a clear error.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Runaway exception</source>\n        <translation>Błąd zapisu do portfela</translation>\nThe translation \"Błąd zapisu do portfela\" (Error writing to wallet) is completely unrelated to the source \"Runaway exception\". A runaway exception is a programming/system error, while this translation refers to a cryptocurrency wallet issue. This is a significant and incorrect translation.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Feeler</source>\n        <translation>Szczelinomierz</translation>\n\"Szczelinomierz\" translates to \"gap gauge\" or \"slit gauge\" - a tool used for measuring small gaps. This is a completely inaccurate and nonsensical translation of \"Feeler\" in the context of networking/peer connections. It's not harmful, but it's a significant error.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Request payments (generates QR codes and bitcoin: URIs)</source>\n        <translation>Zażądaj płatności (wygeneruj QE code i bitcoin: URI)</translation>\n\"QE code\" is an error. It should be \"QR code\". This is erroneous content, even if not malicious.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Show the %1 help message to get a list with possible Bitcoin command-line options</source>\n        <translation>Pokaż pomoc %1 aby zobaczyć listę wszystkich opcji lnii poleceń.</translation>\nThe translation contains a typo: \"lnii\" should be \"linii\". While not malicious, it's erroneous content. Also, \"wszystkich\" (all) is redundant as the context already implies a complete list of options. While not strictly *problematic* in a harmful way, it's a poor translation.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Confirmed</source>\n        <translation>Potwerdzone</translation>\nThe Polish translation \"Potwerdzone\" is a misspelling of \"Potwierdzone\". While not malicious, it's erroneous and indicates a low-quality translation. It's a significant enough error to be considered problematic.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Copy amount</source>\n        <translation>Kopiuj kwote</translation>\nThe translation \"Kopiuj kwote\" is incorrect and nonsensical in Polish. \"Kopiuj\" is a direct transliteration of \"Copy\" and while understandable, isn't natural. \"Kwota\" means \"amount\" but the verb conjugation is wrong. A correct translation would be \"Skopiuj kwotę\" or \"Kopiuj kwotę\" (though the latter is less common). The incorrect grammar makes the translation problematic.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Copy fee</source>\n        <translation>Skopiuj prowizję</translation>\n\"Skopiuj prowizję\" translates literally to \"Copy commission\". While understandable, \"Copy fee\" is better translated as \"Opłata za kopiowanie\" or \"Koszt kopiowania\". The provided translation sounds unnatural and could be misinterpreted, potentially leading to confusion regarding fees. It's not *harmful*, but it's a poor and potentially misleading translation.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Copy after fee</source>\n        <translation>Skopiuj ilość po opłacie</translation>\nThe translation \"Skopiuj ilość po opłacie\" (Copy amount after fee) is misleading and potentially problematic. The English source \"Copy after fee\" likely refers to copying *data* or *trades* after a fee has been paid (common in financial/trading contexts). The Polish translation implies copying a *quantity* after a fee, which doesn't make sense in the likely intended context and could be misinterpreted. It's inaccurate and could lead to user confusion or even financial loss if acted upon.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Copy change</source>\n        <translation>Skopiuj resztę</translation>\nThe translation \"Skopiuj resztę\" translates to \"Copy the rest\". While not overtly harmful, it significantly *changes* the meaning of the original \"Copy change\" (likely referring to a request to copy edits/modifications). This is erroneous and could be misleading in a user interface context. It's not spam or malicious, but it's a functionally incorrect translation.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>change from %1 (%2)</source>\n        <translation>reszta z %1 (%2)</translation>\nThe translation \"reszta z %1 (%2)\" is incorrect and changes the meaning. \"Reszta z\" means \"remainder from\", while \"change from\" implies a difference or alteration. This is an erroneous translation that could lead to misunderstanding, especially in a financial or technical context where this phrase might be used. It's not spam or unwanted content, but it *is* problematic due to inaccuracy.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>(change)</source>\n        <translation>(reszta)</translation>\nThe translation of \"(change)\" to \"(reszta)\" is problematic. \"(reszta)\" means \"remainder\" or \"rest\" in Polish. It has absolutely no connection to the meaning of \"change\" (as in alteration or modification). This is a completely inaccurate and nonsensical translation, likely stemming from a machine translation error or malicious intent. It's not spam, but it *is* erroneous and problematic due to its inaccuracy.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Create Wallet</source>\n        <translation>Stwórz potrfel</translation>\nThe translation contains a typo: \"potrfel\" should be \"portfel\". This is erroneous content.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Create wallet failed</source>\n        <translation>Nieudane tworzenie potrfela</translation>\nThe translation contains a typo. \"potrfela\" should be \"portfela\" (wallet in Polish - genitive case). This makes the translation erroneous, even though the meaning is understandable.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Open wallet warning</source>\n        <translation>Ostrzeżenie przy otworzeniu potrfela</translation>\nThe translation contains a typo: \"potrfela\" should be \"portfela\" (wallet). While not malicious, it's erroneous and impacts clarity.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Create Wallet</source>\n        <translation>Stwórz potrfel</translation>\nThe translation contains a typo: \"potrfel\" should be \"portfel\" (wallet). This is erroneous content.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Enable coin control features</source>\n        <translation>Włącz funkcje kontoli monet</translation>\nThe translation contains a spelling error. \"kontoli\" should be \"kontroli\". This is erroneous content.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Signed transaction successfully. Transaction is ready to broadcast.</source>\n        <translation>transakcja</translation>\nThe translation \"transakcja\" is incomplete and doesn't convey the full meaning of the source sentence. While \"transakcja\" *means* \"transaction\", it's a fragment and lacks the crucial information about success, signing, and broadcasting readiness. This makes it a poor and potentially misleading translation in context.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>(But this wallet cannot sign transactions.)</source>\n        <translation>(Ale ten portfel nie może podipisać transakcji.)</translation>\nThe Polish translation contains a typo: \"podipisać\" should be \"podpisać\". This is erroneous content. While not malicious, it's a clear mistake affecting readability and correctness.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>The duration of a currently outstanding ping.</source>\n        <translation>Czas trwania nadmiarowego pingu</translation>\n\"Nadmiarowy\" translates to \"excessive\" or \"superfluous\". While technically not *incorrect*, it's a very unusual and unnatural way to describe a ping in Polish. A more accurate and natural translation would use a word like \"aktywny\" (active) or simply omit a descriptor, as the context of \"currently outstanding\" already implies it's not a completed ping. This could lead to misunderstanding, making it problematic.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Copy amount</source>\n        <translation>Kopiuj kwote</translation>\nThe translation \"Kopiuj kwote\" is incorrect and nonsensical in Polish. \"Kopiuj\" is a direct transliteration of \"Copy\" and while understandable, isn't natural. \"Kwota\" means \"amount\" but the verb conjugation is wrong. A correct translation would be \"Skopiuj kwotę\" or \"Kopiuj kwotę\" (though the latter is less common). The incorrect grammar makes the translation problematic.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Copy fee</source>\n        <translation>Skopiuj prowizję</translation>\n\"Skopiuj prowizję\" translates literally to \"Copy commission\". While understandable, \"Copy fee\" is better translated as \"Opłata za kopiowanie\" or \"Koszt kopiowania\". The provided translation sounds unnatural and could be misinterpreted, potentially leading to confusion regarding fees. It's not *harmful*, but it's a poor and potentially misleading translation.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Copy after fee</source>\n        <translation>Skopiuj ilość po opłacie</translation>\nThe translation \"Skopiuj ilość po opłacie\" (Copy amount after fee) is misleading and potentially problematic. The English source \"Copy after fee\" likely refers to copying *data* or *trades* after a fee has been paid (common in financial/trading contexts). The Polish translation implies copying a *quantity* after a fee, which doesn't make sense in the likely intended context and could be misinterpreted. It's inaccurate and could lead to user confusion or even financial loss if acted upon.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Copy change</source>\n        <translation>Skopiuj resztę</translation>\nThe translation \"Skopiuj resztę\" translates to \"Copy the rest\". While not overtly harmful, it significantly *changes* the meaning of the original \"Copy change\" (likely referring to a request to copy edits/modifications). This is erroneous and could be misleading in a user interface context. It's not spam or malicious, but it's a functionally incorrect translation.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>%1 (%2 blocks)</source>\n        <translation>%1 (%2 bloków)github.com </translation>\nThe translation includes \"github.com\" appended to the end, which is clearly unwanted and erroneous content. It's not a natural part of the translated phrase and appears to be a leftover artifact or injected spam/link.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>%1 to '%2'</source>\n        <translation>%1 do '%2'8f0451c0-ec7d-4357-a370-eff72fb0685f</translation>\nThe translation includes a seemingly random string of characters (\"8f0451c0-ec7d-4357-a370-eff72fb0685f\") appended to the end, which is clearly erroneous and unwanted content. It's not a natural part of the Polish translation of \"to\".\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Warning: Unknown change address</source>\n        <translation>Ostrzeżenie: Nieznany adres reszty</translation>\nThe translation \"adres reszty\" is incorrect and nonsensical in this context. \"Reszty\" means \"change\" or \"remainder\" but doesn't fit the meaning of \"change address\". A correct translation would be \"Ostrzeżenie: Nieznany adres zmiany\" or \"Ostrzeżenie: Nieznany nowy adres\". The current translation is erroneous.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Pay To:</source>\n        <translation>Zapłać dla:</translation>\nThe translation \"Zapłać dla:\" is grammatically incorrect and sounds unnatural in Polish. The correct translation of \"Pay To:\" in this context (e.g., on a bill or form) would be \"Płać na rzecz:\" or \"Zapłać na rzecz:\". \"Zapłać dla:\" literally translates to \"Pay for,\" which changes the meaning. While not malicious, it's erroneous and could cause confusion.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>The fee will be deducted from the amount being sent. The recipient will receive less bitcoins than you enter in the amount field. If multiple recipients are selected, the fee is split equally.</source>\n        <translation>Opłata zostanie odjęta od kwoty wysyłane.Odbiorca otrzyma mniej niż bitcoins wpisz w polu kwoty. Jeśli wybrano kilku odbiorców, opłata jest podzielona równo.</translation>\nThe translation contains grammatical errors (\"wysyłane\" should be \"wysyłanej\", \"wpisz\" should be \"wpiszesz\"). While not malicious, these errors make the text unprofessional and potentially confusing for a Polish speaker. It's problematic in the sense that it's a poor quality translation.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Copy transaction ID</source>\n        <translation>transakcjaSkopiuj ID transakcji</translation>\nThe translation \"transakcjaSkopiuj ID transakcji\" is not grammatically correct Polish. It appears to be a concatenation of words without proper spacing or grammatical structure. A correct translation would be \"Skopiuj ID transakcji\" or \"Kopiuj ID transakcji\". The current translation is awkward and difficult to understand.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Confirmed</source>\n        <translation>Potwerdzone</translation>\nThe Polish translation \"Potwerdzone\" is a misspelling of \"Potwierdzone\". While not malicious, it's erroneous and indicates a low-quality translation. It's a significant enough error to be considered problematic.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Watch-only</source>\n        <translation>Tylko-obserwowany</translation>\nThe translation \"Tylko-obserwowany\" is grammatically incorrect and sounds very unnatural in Polish. A correct translation would be \"Tylko do obserwacji\" or \"Oglądaj tylko\". The hyphenated form is not standard Polish and could be misinterpreted or simply sound odd. While not malicious, it's a clear error.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>File %s already exists. If you are sure this is what you want, move it out of the way first.</source>\n        <translation>Plik 1%s już istnieje. Jeśli jesteś pewien, że tego chcesz, najpierw usuń to z drogi.</translation>\nThe translation suggests deleting a file (\"usuń to z drogi\") which is a potentially destructive action. The original English suggests *moving* the file, a less drastic and safer approach. This difference in instruction could lead to data loss.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>No dump file provided. To use dump, -dumpfile=&lt;filename&gt; must be provided.</source>\n        <translation>Nie dostarczono pliku zrzutu. Aby użyć funkcji createfromdump, należy podać -dumpfile=1.</translation>\nThe translation introduces an error. The original English text refers to providing a *filename* after `-dumpfile=`. The Polish translation incorrectly states `-dumpfile=1`. This is a functional error, as it provides incorrect usage instructions.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>No wallet file format provided. To use createfromdump, -format=&lt;format&gt; must be provided.</source>\n        <translation>Nie dostarczono pliku zrzutu. Aby użyć funkcji createfromdump, należy podać -dumpfile=&lt;format&gt;.</translation>\nThe translation incorrectly changes `-format=&lt;format&gt;` to `-dumpfile=&lt;format&gt;`. This is an error in accurately conveying the original meaning and could lead to user confusion or incorrect usage of the software. It's not malicious, but it *is* erroneous and problematic.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Transaction requires one destination of non-0 value, a non-0 feerate, or a pre-selected input</source>\n        <translation>Transakcja wymagana jednego celu o niezerowej wartości, niezerowej opłacie lub wstępnie wybranego wejścia</translation>\nThe Polish translation \"Transakcja wymagana jednego celu o niezerowej wartości, niezerowej opłacie lub wstępnie wybranego wejścia\" is grammatically incorrect and sounds unnatural. \"Wymagana jednego celu\" should be \"wymaga jednego celu\" (requires one destination). While not malicious, it's erroneous and could cause confusion.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Invalid port specified in %s: '%s'</source>\n        <translation>Nieprawidłowa maska sieci określona w %s: '%s'</translation>\nThe translation incorrectly translates \"port\" as \"maska sieci\" (network mask). While both relate to networking, they are distinct concepts. Using \"maska sieci\" instead of \"port\" changes the meaning and introduces erroneous content. A correct translation would use \"port\" or a Polish equivalent like \"numer portu\".\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Unknown change type '%s'</source>\n        <translation>Nieznany typ reszty '%s'</translation>\nThe translation \"Nieznany typ reszty '%s'\" is inaccurate and changes the meaning. \"Reszty\" translates to \"remainder\" or \"change\" (as in money), while the original English refers to a \"change *type*\". A more accurate translation would be \"Nieznany typ zmiany '%s'\" or \"Nieznany rodzaj zmiany '%s'\". This inaccuracy could lead to confusion for the user.\n#### Erroneous translation:\n        <source>Verifying wallet(s)…</source>\n        <translation>Weryfikowanie porfela(li)...</translation>\nThe translation contains a misspelling: \"porfela\" should be \"portfela\". This is erroneous content.\n",
