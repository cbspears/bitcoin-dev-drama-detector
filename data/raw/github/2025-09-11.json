      "body": "## Summary\n\nThis PR fixes issue #25980 where `combinerawtransaction` would silently accept unrelated transactions and only use the first one, ignoring the rest.\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen passed two or more unrelated transactions (transactions with different inputs/outputs), `combinerawtransaction` would:\n- Take the first transaction as the base\n- Silently ignore the unrelated parts of subsequent transactions\n- Only merge signatures for matching inputs\n\nThis behavior was confusing and could lead to unexpected results where users think they're combining transactions but actually only getting the first one back.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdded validation to ensure all transactions being combined are actually the same transaction (with potentially different signatures). The validation checks that all transactions have:\n- The same number of inputs and outputs\n- Identical input outpoints and sequences\n- Identical output values and scripts\n- The same version and locktime\n\nIf any transaction differs from the first, the RPC now throws a descriptive error indicating which transaction is unrelated.\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded test coverage in `test/functional/rpc_rawtransaction.py` that verifies:\n1. Unrelated transactions are properly rejected with an appropriate error message\n2. Related transactions (same transaction structure) can still be combined successfully\n\nFixes #25980",

      "body": "## Summary\r\nThis PR fixes issue #33320 by adding explicit validation for invalid taproot key path signatures in the `analyzepsbt` RPC command.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nCurrently, when a PSBT contains an invalid `taproot_key_path_sig`, `analyzepsbt` returns a confusing status of `\"next\": \"updater\"` instead of properly reporting the validation error. This can happen when external applications incorrectly construct PSBTs.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- Added validation in `AnalyzePSBT` to check for invalid taproot key path signatures\r\n- Check signature length (must be 64 or 65 bytes for valid Schnorr signatures)\r\n- Return clear error message when signature is invalid\r\n- Added test coverage in `rpc_psbt.py`\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Added functional test that verifies the error is properly reported for PSBTs with invalid taproot signatures\r\n- Existing tests continue to pass\r\n\r\nFixes #33320\r\n",

See [#31339](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31339).\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31349 is an attempt to detect such cases in CI. In the [discussions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31349#pullrequestreview-3185369594) on that PR a complementary idea came up - to use a mocked socket from unit tests to detect such usage. That could be done in addition if there is support for it and if not too complicated.\n\nI guess, if this is to be done, either `CreateSock()` should be changed from `BasicTestingSetup` to throw right away or return a mocked `Sock` object that has a real underlying socket and throws on attempts to create non-loopback connections.",
