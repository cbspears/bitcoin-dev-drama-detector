      "body": "It allows fetching specific transactions using an external index, following https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32541#issuecomment-3267485313 and will be used by https://github.com/romanz/bindex (allowing much more efficient encoding).\r\n\r\nCurrently, electrs and other indexers map between an address/scripthash to the list of the relevant transactions.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to fetch those transactions from bitcoind, electrs relies on reading the whole block and post-filtering for a specific transaction[^1]. \r\nOther indexers use a `txindex` to fetch a transaction using its txid [^2][^3][^4]. This approach has significant storage and CPU overhead, since the `txid` is a pseudo-random 32-byte value. Also, mainnet `txindex` takes ~60GB today.\r\n\r\nThis PR is adding support for using the transaction's position within its block to be able to fetch it directly using [REST API](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md), using the following HTTP request:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /rest/blockpart/BLOCKHASH.bin?offset=OFFSET&size=SIZE\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The offsets' index can be encoded much more efficiently ([~1.3GB today](https://github.com/romanz/bindex-rs/pull/66#issuecomment-3508476436)).\r\n\r\n- Address history query performance can be tested on mainnet using [1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE](https://mempool.space/address/1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE) - assuming warm OS block cache, [it takes <1s to fetch 5200 txs, i.e. <0.2ms per tx](https://github.com/romanz/bindex-rs/pull/66#issuecomment-3508476436) with [bindex](https://github.com/romanz/bindex-rs).\r\n\r\n- Only binary and hex response formats are supported.\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://github.com/romanz/electrs/blob/master/doc/schema.md\r\n[^2]: https://github.com/Blockstream/electrs/blob/new-index/doc/schema.md#txstore\r\n[^3]: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx/blob/master/docs/HOWTO.rst#prerequisites\r\n[^4]: https://github.com/cculianu/Fulcrum/blob/master/README.md#requirements\r\n\r\n",

It does not modify Guix, depends, or existing build/release workflows.\n\n\n---\n\nWhat’s included\n\n1. Devcontainer\n\nAdds a .devcontainer/ folder with:\n\ndevcontainer.json and post-create.sh for local or Codespaces builds.\n\nPreconfigured environment with toolchains, Python deps, and ccache.\n\nSpeeds up local iteration and CI parity.\n\n\n2. CMake Presets\n\nExtends CMakePresets.json with additional developer presets:\n\ndev-debug, asan, tsan, fuzz, and release-lto.\n\nSimplifies common workflows (debugging, fuzzing, sanitizers).\n\nFully optional and backward-compatible.\n\n\n3. Documentation\n\nNew contributor-focused guides under doc/:\n\ngetting-started.md — build/test workflow in five commands.\n\nfuzzing.md — building, running, and contributing fuzz tests.\n\n\n4. CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nAdds clear templates for:\n\nTest plan — required for code PRs (build preset, repro steps, rollback).\n\nPerformance evidence — for PRs impacting runtime performance.\n\n\n5. SECURITY.md\n\nExpands scope and process:\n\nClarifies response targets (72h ack / 7d triage).\n\nDefines embargo/coordination policy.\n\nAdds placeholder section for maintainer PGP fingerprints.\n\n\n\n---\n\nRationale\n\nFaster onboarding — single command to build and test.\n\nConsistent CI runs — unified CMake presets.\n\nMore predictable reviews — standardized test plans.\n\nBetter transparency — formalized security response policy.\n\n\n\n---\n\nTesting\n\nValidated locally via:\n\ncmake --preset dev-debug && cmake --build --preset dev-debug -j$(nproc)\nctest --test-dir build/dev-debug --output-on-failure\ntest/functional/test_runner.py --jobs=$(nproc)\n\nAlso verified ASan and Fuzz presets build successfully.\n\n\n---\n\nCommits\n\n1. Devcontainer setup (.devcontainer/*)\n\n\n2. Docs: getting-started.md + fuzzing.md\n\n\n3. Policies: updates to CONTRIBUTING.md and SECURITY.md\n\nFeedback from maintainers on CMake preset naming conventions, doc locations, and security response SLAs is welcome before merge.\n\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
