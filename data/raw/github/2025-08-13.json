      "title": "wallet, test: Ancient Wallet Migration from v0.14.3 (no-HD and Single Chain)",
      "body": "This PR adds test coverage for migrating legacy Bitcoin Core wallets from v0.14.3 (released in 2017) to the descriptor wallet format. The test validates that users can safely upgrade their wallets while preserving all funds, transaction history, and addresses.\r\n\r\nThis test was originally developed on top of #32977, as it was requested in reviews.\r\nHowever, since it also increases test coverage, it can be merged independently.\r\n\r\nThe test covers two wallet migration scenarios:\r\n\r\n* Non-HD Wallet Migration - Tests migration of non-HD wallets (created with `-usehd=0`)\r\n* Single Chain HD Wallet Migration - Tests migration of HD wallets from v0.14.3 (`VERSION_HD_BASE`)\r\n\r\nThe node v0.14.3 cannot be synced because it doesn't have the `syncwithvalidationinterfacequeue` RPC implemented (required by `test_framework.py`), so the solution is to copy the `block` folder to the modern node and start it with `-reindex-chainstate`. Because of this additional complexity, this testing is best managed in a separate file rather than in the existing migration test files.\r\n\r\n",

The fundamental issue is that the --gen-test-data code path uses outdated testing patterns that are prone to breaking with framework changes. By modernizing to MiniWallet, we ensure the test follows current best practices and stays compatible with future framework updates.\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to just add self.add_wallet_options(parser) and replace deprecated RPCs, but that leaves the test using legacy patterns that could break again.
