This prevented the test harness from cleaning up its temporary directory.\r\n\r\nHmm, haven't dug deeper but this does not seem to be completely accurate. The `WalletContext` is not global. It is created at the beginning of the benchmark, just after creating the test context (which is the one that calls to the `fs::removal_all` that crashes during destruction).\r\n\r\nThat said, I think you could just construct a wallet loader instead of manually removing the wallets in the code we want to benchmark. The loader internally creates a `WalletContext` and unloads all wallets during destruction.

After the first invocation moved the wallet (std::move(wallet)), subsequent iterations operated on a moved-from object, leading to undefined behavior. While re-creating the wallet in each iteration would have worked, it defeats the purpose of measuring migration performance. Since the benchmark is already slow and likely intended to run only once, the iteration count was capped at one.\r\n\r\nWhen we run the benchmark in the CI, we provide the `-sanity-check` flag, which already sets `bench.epochs(1).epochIterations(1)`.
