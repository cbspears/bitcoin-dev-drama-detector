The old fallback then zero‑wrote inside the file and corrupted data. This PR makes the fallback defensive by appending after EOF only, so even if a caller violates the promise, we still don’t overwrite (?).\r\n\r\nBut what about the guarantee from the doc of `AllocateFileRange`? Should we dismiss this guarantee? Maybe we should clarify which assumptions we can make e.g. `filesize < offset` (only appending at the end)  or `offset + length > filesize` (no shrinking because if I am not mistaken `SetEndOfFile` / `ftruncate` will then shrink the file, potentially erasing live data). So we should guard against that?",

For details on \"Quantum-Resistant Bitcoin with SPHINCS+-SHAKE256f\", see:\r\n→ [Quantum-Resistant Bitcoin](https://quantum-resistant-bitcoin.bitcoin.foundation/).\r\n\r\nIf our BIP proposal is eventually accepted, Bitcoin Core will require further modifications to support SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256f, particularly due to its ~50 KB signature sizes. Currently, there is no viable alternative among standardized quantum-resistant algorithms. The other NIST-approved options are lattice-based, which may not provide sufficient long-term security against advances in quantum computing. \r\n\r\n### Final Recommendation:\r\nGiven the lack of an \"official\" BIP-360, I strongly advise against merging this PR.

      "body": "Ever since Bitcoin Core moved from legacy HD wallets to descriptor wallets, we lost one of the best features: a single, human-readable seed (BIP39-style) that could restore everything.\n\nRight now descriptor wallets are a pain to back up. You’ve got to dump a bunch of long, ugly descriptor strings, and if you ever add a new descriptor you’ve got to back it up again or risk losing access. It’s harder for regular users and even for technical people it’s just more work.\n\nLegacy wallets weren’t perfect, but the 12–24 word seed backup was simple, portable, and nearly impossible to mess up. Descriptor wallets might be the future, but they shouldn’t require a PhD to back up safely.\n\nI’m asking to add an option when creating a descriptor wallet to generate a single master seed (BIP39 or similar) that covers all wallet keys. If you want complex setups with multiple xpubs, fine, but let single-seed wallets be restorable from one backup.\n\nThe way it is now, it’s too easy for people to end up with incomplete backups. Descriptor wallets should be better than legacy in every way, not worse in something as basic as backup and restore.",
