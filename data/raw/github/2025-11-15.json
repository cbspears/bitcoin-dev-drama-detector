The primary input for the documentation was the documentation that already existed in the Python implementation (`contrib/asmap/asmap.py`) but there are several other comments as well. Please note: I have also asked several LLMs to provide suggestions on how to explain pieces of the implementation and better demonstrate how the parts work together. I have copied bits and pieces that I liked but everything has been edited further by me and obviously all mistakes here are my own. ",
