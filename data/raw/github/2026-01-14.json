Use `OP_1` for the second signature instead of `OP_0`.\r\n\r\n63ff7c4158a46ff5d726a576e3ac1f384e6cc2b7: Copy existing `STRICTENC` tests and change the flag to `DERSIG`. `DERSIG` is a consensus flag (unlike `STRICTENC`), so it'd be good to have dedicated test cases.\r\n\r\n`script_tests` pass on my end.",

Also, `STRICTENC` is a policy flag, we should default to consensus flags in `script_tests`.\r\n\r\nThe diff is large but mechanical as I'm only removing `STRICTENC` from flags.

Keeping it as a draft right now, to assess if there is conceptual support. The goal would be to keep the test framework code maintained here to Bitcoin Core specific parts and develop secp256k1-specific parts (e.g. MuSig, Silent Payments, FROST etc., to name a few upcoming ones) in secp256k1lab. I'm not sure if that's a clear win from a maintenance perspective (it could e.g. add friction, having to depend on and coordinate with secp256k1lab maintainers), but I'm curious to hear opinions. Suggested e.g. in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32642#pullrequestreview-2881144268.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are still some problems and open questions:\r\n* CI for \"Windows native\" job is failing (didn't check in detail yet, but I assume the secp256k1lab folder is not found due to failing Path.resolve() symlink resolution, i.e. the library is searched within the build folder)\r\n* BIP340 signing/verification can't be fully replaced yet (the test framework's Schnorr signing in `key.py`uses special testing parameters like `flip_p` and `flip_r` that aren't available in secp256k1lab)\r\n* Where to place the subtree? Originally I added it in `test_framework/crypto` but moved it up directly to `test`, for not having to add a linter mypy exception, as it only targets `test/functional/*`; maybe adding the subtree to a new folder like `test/libs` would be better for clarity",

This is expected behavior because:\n- The wallet loading code checks if required blocks are available for rescanning\n- During assumeutxo background sync, blocks before the snapshot are not available\n- This applies to all wallets, including watch-only wallets created at the snapshot height\n\nThis is a valuable test addition because it documents this expected behavior and ensures it doesn't regress. Users should be aware that if they restart their node during assumeutxo background sync, they won't be able to load their wallets until the background sync completes.\n\n## Related\n\nrefs #28648\n\nAddresses the TODO comment that was originally added as part of the assumeutxo wallet test implementation.",

use the native `WriteBatch` size estimator for accuracy and maintainability.\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31490 - reduce redundant serialization work and simplify disk-write code paths.\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31534 - make long shutdown flushes visible to users.\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30906 - de-risk coins cache refactors by tightening/cleaning the cache-entry interface.\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30039 - reduce LevelDB writes/compactions/open files by bumping LevelDB max file size to 32 MiB.\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31064 - avoid unnecessary coins DB reopen and cache reallocation on startup.\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30849 - clarify API semantics and align tests with reachable cache states.\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30884 - cache file position within `AutoFile` (Windows regression fix).\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28358 - allow the full UTXO set to fit into memory by dropping the `-dbcache` limit.\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30326 - avoid double lookups by using `try_emplace()`.\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28280 - keep the coins cache warm across prune flushes for faster block connection.\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28233 - keep the coins cache warm across periodic flushes.\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26326 - reduce validation lock contention by moving disk reads out of `cs_main`.\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26415 - avoid deserializing when serving raw block data (`getblock` verbosity 0, REST bin/hex, ZMQ).\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25325 - use a pool-based memory resource for the in-memory cache (large IBD speedup at the time).\n\n## Related context and superseded attempts (reference)\n\n  * https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32043 -
