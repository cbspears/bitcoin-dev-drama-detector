      "title": "Fix failing util_time_GetTime test on Windows",
      "body": "Remove unreliable steady clock time checking from the test that was causing CI failures primarily on Windows. The test previously tried to verify that  steady_clock time increases after a 1ms sleep, but this approach is not reliable on all platforms where such a short sleep interval may not consistently result in observable clock changes.\r\n\r\nThis addresses issue #32197 where the test was reporting failures in the  cross-built Windows CI environment. As noted in the discussion, the test is not critical to the functionality of Bitcoin Core, and removing the unreliable part is the most straightforward solution.\r\n",

      "title": "kernel: Separate UTXO set access from validation functions",
      "body": "The current code makes it hard to call functions for checking the consensus-correctness of a block without having a full UTXO set at hand. This makes implementing features such as Utreexo and non-assumevalid swiftsync, where maintaining a full UTXO set defeats their purpose, through the kernel API difficult. Checks like the coinbase subsidy, or block sigops are only available through `ConnectBlock`, which requires a complete coins cache.\r\n\r\nSolve this by moving accessing coins and the responsibility of spending them out of `ConnectBlock` and into a new separate function called `SpendBlock`. Pass a block's spent coins through the existing `CBlockUndo` data structure to `ConnectBlock`. \r\n\r\nWhile the change is largely a refactor, some smaller behaviour changes were unavoidable. These should be highlighted in the commit messages. The last commit contains the most important part of the coins logic move, the commits before attempt to prepare it piecemeal.\r\n\r\nThis pull request was benchmarked on [benchcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-tools/benchcoin/pull/162), which showed no performance regression. While discussing this pull request it was noted that pre-fetching and eliminating the need for some additional map lookups might improve performance a bit, but this does not make a measurable difference in the grand scheme of things and was not the motivation for this pull request.\r\n\r\nIn future changes, ConnectBlock could be made even more self contained, accessing the coins from the internal map could be further optimized by consolidating existence checking and spending, and the function eventually exposed in an external kernel API (as done [here](https://github.com/sedited/bitcoin/commit/09e05493010119fc60d310d3e7ffc388de441f9a#diff-f638e65d9278276b2a6ac42ffbbd26d079c3dba752feed5038a25a1ee565d320R947))",

To prevent this issue, it is proposed to convert even-numbered values to binary, improving transaction security and blockchain integrity.Currently, double spending can occur in certain digital currency transactions, potentially compromising security. The blockchain system and consensus algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW) aim to prevent this issue, but further optimizations are needed.
