      "title": "test: Remove `system_tests/run_command` runtime dependencies",
      "body": "`system_tests` currently rely on `cat`, `echo`, `false` and `sh` being available in `PATH` at runtime.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n1. Removes these dependencies.\r\n2. Reduces the number of platform-specific code paths.\r\n\r\nThe change is primarily motivated by my work on maintaining the [`bitcoin-core`](https://packages.guix.gnu.org/packages/bitcoin-core) package in Guix. It enables the removal of the existing `bash` and `coreutils` native inputs, which in turn makes it possible to drop the implicit dependency on `qtbase@5` (see https://codeberg.org/guix/guix/pulls/4386#issuecomment-8613333).",

I can delete the two lines, save the file and immediately regain access to bitcoin-cli. At no point have I stopped and started the node, just modifying the file. In the past, I know you are supposed to restart the node for changes to take effect so I'm really not sure what's going on. Can someone enlighten me to the new behavior?\n\nRunning on Debian 13.\n\nCurrent conf file:\n```\nserver=1\ntxindex=1\ndaemon=1\nrpcport=8332\nrpcbind=0.0.0.0\nrpcallowip=127.0.0.1\nrpcallowip=10.0.0.0/8\nrpcallowip=172.0.0.0/8\nrpcallowip=192.0.0.0/8\nzmqpubrawblock=tcp://0.0.0.0:28332\nzmqpubrawtx=tcp://0.0.0.0:28333\nzmqpubhashblock=tcp://0.0.0.0:28334\nwhitelist=127.0.0.1\ndisablewallet=1\ndbcache=2048\nmaxconnections=125\n```\n\n*Edit: did rpcauth.py and everything works as expected. I assume this means that the old user and pass lines are fully deprecated?",

Since you haven't restarted Bitcoin Core yet, your new credentials aren't being used by the RPC server, but `bitcoin-cli` is trying to use them, hence an unauthorized error.\n\nWhen you use `rpcauth`, the password is not included directly in the `bitcoin.conf` so the RPC server still creates the cookie file which `bitcoin-cli` still uses in that mode. If you tried to specify the `rpcauth` credentials with `bitcoin-cli -rpcuser=<user> -rpcpassword=<password>`, it would also fail until you restart Bitcoin Core.",
