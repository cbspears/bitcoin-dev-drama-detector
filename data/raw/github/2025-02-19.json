Fix this by introducing a unit test which would break if the snapshot data the fuzz target relies on were to change.\r\n\r\nIn implementing this i noticed the height used for coins in the fuzz target is actually off-by-one (as if the first block in the created chain was the genesis but it's block `1`), so fix that too.",
