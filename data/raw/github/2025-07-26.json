      "title": "[POC] wallet: Add Support for BIP-353 DNS-Based Bitcoin Address via External Resolver",
      "body": "This PR implements [BIP-353](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0353.mediawiki) support in Bitcoin Core's wallet, enabling users to send Bitcoin to human-readable usernames instead of traditional addresses.\r\n\r\n### What is BIP-353?\r\nBIP-353 specifies a method for resolving human-friendly payment instructions via DNS. Instead of sharing long Bitcoin addresses, users can share memorable usernames like `alice._bitcoin-payment.example.com`.\r\n\r\n### Key Features\r\n\r\n* New `-dnsresolver` option: Specify a DNSSEC-validating DNS resolver command to handle BIP-353 lookups\r\n* Seamless integration: The `sendtoaddress` RPC now accepts both traditional Bitcoin addresses and BIP-353 usernames\r\n* Automatic resolution: When a BIP-353 username is provided, it's automatically resolved to a Bitcoin address before processing the transaction\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\n1. Users provide a username in the format: `username._bitcoin-payment.domain.com`\r\n2. The wallet validates the username format\r\n3. If valid and a DNS resolver is configured, it queries the DNS TXT record\r\n4. The resolver returns a `bitcoin:` URI containing the destination address\r\n5. The transaction proceeds with the resolved address\r\n\r\n### Example Usage\r\n```bash\r\n# Configure DNS resolver\r\nbitcoind -dnsresolver=\"/home/user/dns-bitcoin-resolver\"\r\n\r\n# Send to a BIP-353 username\r\nbitcoin-cli sendtoaddress \"alice.user._bitcoin-payment.alice.com\" 0.01\r\n```\r\n\r\n###  Implementation Details\r\n\r\n* Validates usernames according to DNS naming rules and BIP-353 format\r\n* Handles FQDN format (with or without trailing dot)\r\n* Provides error messages for resolution failures\r\n* Falls back to traditional address validation if the input isn't a valid BIP-353 username\r\n\r\nP.S.: There is an example `-dnsresolver` application here: https://github.com/w0xlt/dns-bitcoin-resolver for testing\r\n\r\nThe idea of this PR is to gather feedback on whether this direction makes sense and how we might best implement BIP-353 support if there's interest. \r\nThis would be even better if combined with Silent Payment and DNS resolver with DNSSEC validation could also solve some issues related to Payjoin V2 implementation in Core.",

Validating DNSSEC signatures is an integral part of BIP 353 and the only way we can guarantee that the proof is valid is for us to receive the prrof and validate it internally, which defeats the purpose of calling another binary.\r\n\r\nUnlike with `-signer`, I don't think there's a good reason to use a separate binary for the DNS lookups. There is no need for minimizing attack surface since we already do DNS lookups via syscalls. I don't think there's a situation where the called binary would need to be any different. It's not like HWI where the binary may support different hardware; rather there's exactly one thing that it is supposed to do, so I think it would be better for us to (re)write TXT resolving and DNSSEC validation internally.",

These changes reduce test complexity and improve overall test runtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
