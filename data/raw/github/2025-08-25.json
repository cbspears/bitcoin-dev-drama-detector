      "title": "wallet: Replace fee magic numbers with named constants",
      "body": "## Summary\n\nThis PR addresses a TODO item in the wallet fee handling code by replacing magic numbers with descriptive named constants. It also adds `constexpr` constructors to `CFeeRate` to support compile-time constants.\n\n## Changes\n\n- **Add `constexpr` CFeeRate constructors** to support compile-time constants\n- **Replace magic `CFeeRate(0)` values** with descriptive named constants:\n  - `DEFAULT_FEERATE` for default/unset fee rates\n  - `NO_FEE_DATA` for fee estimation failures  \n  - `FEERATE_DISABLED` for disabled fee features\n- **Remove resolved TODO comment** in `src/wallet/fees.cpp:44` (magic value of 0)\n- **Update comments** to be more descriptive\n\n## Benefits\n\nThis improves code readability and maintainability by:\n- Eliminating magic numbers and centralizing fee rate constants\n- Making the code's intent clearer\n- Reducing the risk of mistakes when comparing fee rates in different contexts\n- Enabling compile-time constant initialization with `constexpr` constructors\n- Providing compile-time safety for fee rate constants\n\n## Testing\n\n- [x] Local build successful (RelWithDebInfo, GCC 12.2.0, Linux)\n- [x] No behavioral changes introduced\n- [x] No new compiler warnings\n\n**Note**: Local development build only - not a full Guix reproducible build.\n\n## Related\n\nFixes TODO item in `src/wallet/fees.cpp:44`",
