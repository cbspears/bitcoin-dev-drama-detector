      "body": "Part of #30289.\r\n\r\nBefore, the implicit ordering of transactions in a TxGraph's main graph is sorted by:\r\n- feerate, high to low\r\n- `Cluster`, low to high `m_sequence`\r\n- linearization order within clusters\r\n\r\nHowever, since `m_sequence` values are assigned deterministically and predictably, the ordering of same-feerate distinct-Cluster transactions can reveal something about the order they were inserted into `TxGraph`.\r\n\r\nIn #28676, this ordering (through `TxGraph::CompareMainOrder`) is used to decide the order of to-be-announced transactions. These should not expose information about insertion order.\r\n\r\nTo deal with this, do not compare the `m_sequence` values directly, but hash them with a fixed but random key first. In case this yields a collision (which needs ~192000 clusters to have a probability of 10^-9 of existing), fall back to comparing the `m_sequence` values directly.\r\n\r\nAlternatives: we could instead use the pre-cluster-mempool approach of sorting by wtxid in case of ties, which is equally non-revealing, and deterministic. I find it cleaner to have a randomized internal total ordering rather than needing a partial ordering within `TxGraph` that needs to be complemented by tie-breaking logic inside the mempool, however, and I don't think the determinism is that valuable.\r\n\r\nFor context: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28676#discussion_r2328804847\r\n",

Size at least has some bearing on the block building logic, but it's not clear to me that smallest-first is necessarily best: if the block boundary falls near the end of a group of equal-feerate chunks, you'd want the smallest ones at the end.

I think you'll probably have to eliminate all non-determinism one way or another eventually if this sort order is eventually used for efficient block relay.  It may be desirable to eliminate it now so it doesn't have to be done later and so e.g. metrics that determine if miners are censoring transactions get less noise from randomness here, or even compact block reconstruction rates are less harmed by differences in eviction choices if the network starts evicting.  They're fringe benefits (at least now) but I'm not aware of wtxid grinding to get a slight tiebreak advantage ever having been a concern.

I feel like we should make a decision for what properties are desirable, and then implement it consistently. I think we definitely want highest-feerate chunk first (that's what cluster mempool is), and probably want `PostLinearize()` within chunks, as they are objective (even though `PostLinearize()`'s quality improvement isn't actually observable without sub-chunk block template building). But besides those, we could decide:\r\n\r\n* Preference for smaller size or not? While smallest doesn't directly mean better, it's at least objectively relevant to block building, and *if* grinding is somehow an outcome, grinding for smaller size is probably not terrible.\r\n  * (s) Preference for size.\r\n    * For (1), prefer smaller clusters first (h) or smaller equal-feerate-chunks-before (c)\r\n    * For (2), prefer smaller chunks like now.\r\n    * For (3), prefer smaller transactions within chunks first. Optionally (f) or not (m) it could involve preferring higher-feerate transactions within a chunk first too, before preferring smaller size.\r\n  * (u) Do not discriminate based on size at all (including no preference for smaller chunks).\r\n* How to tie-break the rest:\r\n  * (r) Randomly.\r\n  * (t) By txid.\r\n    * For (1), pick lower sum of txids (as bigint) of the whole cluster (h) or sum of txids of equal-feerate-chunks-before (c).\r\n    * For (2), pick chunk with smallest sum of txids first.\r\n    * For (3), pick lowest txid transaction first.\r\n  * (w) Like (t), but use wtxids rather than txids. I think this is (very slightly) worse as it might encourage witness grinding which is slightly easier than full txid grinding, and doesn't have any benefits as far as I can see.\r\n  * (d) Like (t), but use a salted hash of txids rather than directly. This avoids a global bias, and thus avoids grinding, but unlike (r) it is per-host deterministic (and thus won't randomly change any time a cluster is modified).\r\n\r\nI think all of these are doable for implementation. For any of the versions with dependency on wtxid (d/t/w) I think it would involve handing `TxGraph` a callback function which computes a score based on mempool data (as `TxGraph` doesn't have access to wtxids directly).\r\n\r\n* The easiest solution is (ur). Everything random, including no preference for smallest chunk first.\r\n* If size preference is a good discriminator, I think (scfr) makes sense, and probably gets rid of most non-determinism.\r\n* If we want fully deterministic, (scft), but it comes at the cost of some implementation complexity.\r\n\r\nMarking as draft until decided what approach we want.",

Like size it has an advantage that if someone is \"gaming\" it that's a good-ish thing. \r\n\r\nIndeed, but I don't think it's particularly useful. It should be pretty rare to have a different number of outputs if the size is already the same. And similarly, after grinding for smaller size (which probably already means fewer outputs) you can't really make the number of outputs smaller while keeping the size the same. There is also some CPU/memory cost to having more criteria, especially if it somehow turns out that they need to be cached on a per-chunk basis (which may be the case for (c)).\r\n\r\n> You could prefer the lowest maximum confirmed input height as a tie breaker before TXID: It's a deterministic, naturally scarce resource-- and favoring the coins that have moved less recently in the event of a tie seems healthy.\r\n\r\nHa, tie-break by anti-priority.\r\n\r\n> Does your comparison need to obey the triangle inequality-- I assume not if you could decide 'randomly'? H(sorted(txid_a,txid_b))^txid_a < H(sorted(txid_a,txid_b))^txid_b as the tiebraker? this can't usefully be ground.\r\n\r\nYes, it needs to be consistent. In the current implementation, that's achieved by mapping everything to a score function and comparing the scores. For random, the score isn't actually a function, just a randomly-generated value assigned to each chunk/transaction.\r\n\r\nFor (2) and (3), any scoring function works (even if the result is some complicated tuple of uint256s and feerates), really, because it's internal to the linearization algorithm. Compute once for each chunk/txn throw into the decision-making heaps.\r\n\r\nFor (1), it's more complicated, because it either needs to be cached per chunk/cluster, or recomputed any time two equal-feerate chunks are sorted. Furthermore, it must respect chunk ordering within clusters. So we need something that can be implemented as a function of (cluster, chunk within that cluster), in such a way that f(cluster, chunk_pos1) <= f(cluster, chunk_pos2) if chunk_pos1 <= chunk_pos2 and the two chunks have equal feerate. That's why I suggest sums of values (sizes, or hashes) of the whole cluster, or of equal-feerate chunk prefixes; those are naturally monotonically increasing with chunk position. Anything that's just a function of cluster satisfies this, however.\r\n\r\nSo it's possible for both (1) and (2) to just use SHA256(concat(sorted(txids))) or so (for all txids within cluster, or all txids within chunk). But I'm not sure that is desirable, because it means any new transaction could completely change the existing orderings.\r\n",

      "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nOversized allocations can cause out-of-memory errors or [heavy swapping](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os/issues/64#issuecomment-663637321), [grinding the system to a halt](https://x.com/murchandamus/status/1964432335849607224).\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nAdded a minimal system helper to query total physical RAM on [Linux/macOS/Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2513561) (on unsupported platforms we just disable this warning completely).\r\nThe added test checks if the value is roughly correct by checking if the CI platforms are returning any value and if the value is at least 1 GB (as a simple property test checking if the unit size is correct, e.g. doesn't return megabytes or bits).\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n`LogOversizedDbCache()` now emits a startup warning if the configured `-dbcache` exceeds a cap derived from system RAM, using the same parsing/clamping as cache sizing via `CalculateDbCacheBytes()`. This isn't meant as a recommended setting, rather a likely upper limit.\r\n\r\nNote that we're not modifying the set value, just issuing a warning.\r\nAlso note that the 75% calculation is rounded for the last two numbers since we have to divide first before multiplying, otherwise we wouldn't stay inside `size_t` on 32-bit systems - and this was simpler than casting back and forth.\r\n\r\nWe could have chosen the remaining free memory for the warning (e.g. warn if free memory is less than 1 GiB), but this is just a heuristic, we assumed that on systems with a lot of memory, other processes are also running, while memory constrained ones run only Core.\r\n\r\n### Cap\r\n\r\nIf total RAM < 2 GiB, cap is `DEFAULT_DB_CACHE` (`450 MiB`), otherwise it's 75% of total RAM.\r\nThe threshold is chosen to be close to values commonly used in [raspiblitz](https://github.com/raspiblitz/raspiblitz/blob/dev/home.admin/_provision.setup.sh#L98-L115) for common setups:\r\n\r\n| Total RAM | `dbcache` (MiB) | raspiblitz % | proposed cap (MiB) |\r\n|----------:|----------------:|-------------:|-------------------:|\r\n|     1 GiB |             512 |        50.0% |               450* |\r\n|     2 GiB |            1536 |        75.0% |               1536 |\r\n|     4 GiB |            2560 |        62.5% |               3072 |\r\n|     8 GiB |            4096 |        50.0% |               6144 |\r\n|    16 GiB |            4096 |        25.0% |              12288 |\r\n|    32 GiB |            4096 |        12.5% |              24576 |\r\n\r\n[Umbrel issues](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os/issues/64#issuecomment-663816367) also mention 75% being the upper limit.\r\n\r\n### Reproducer\r\n\r\nStarting `bitcoind` on an 8 GiB rpi4b with a dbcache of 7 GiB:\r\n> ./build/bin/bitcoind -dbcache=7000\r\n\r\nwarns now as follows:\r\n```\r\n2025-09-07T17:24:29Z [warning] A 7000 MiB dbcache may be too large for a system memory of only 7800 MiB.\r\nWarning: A 7000 MiB dbcache may be too large for a system memory of only 7800 MiB.\r\n2025-09-07T17:24:29Z Cache configuration:\r\n2025-09-07T17:24:29Z * Using 2.0 MiB for block index database\r\n2025-09-07T17:24:29Z * Using 8.0 MiB for chain state database\r\n2025-09-07T17:24:29Z * Using 6990.0 MiB for in-memory UTXO set (plus up to 286.1 MiB of unused mempool space)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Manual testing\r\n\r\nBesides the [godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/ec81Tjvrj) reproducers for the new total memory method, we also tested the warnings manually on:\r\n- [x] Apple M4 Max, macOS 15.6.1\r\n- [x] Intel Core i9-9900K, Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS\r\n- [x] Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, Armbian Linux 6.12.22-current-bcm2711\r\n- [x] Intel Xeon x64, Windows 11 Home Version 24H2, OS Build 26100.4351",

(https://godbolt.org/z/Y6c8qjo5s)\r\n\r\n<details><summary>\r\n\r\n#### Minimal demonstration\r\n\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/5j7hEY8zs\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n\r\nclass no_move\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    int val{};\r\n\r\n    no_move(int x) : val(x) {}\r\n\r\n    no_move(const no_move& b) {\r\n        std::cout << \"Copy Constructor called\" << std::endl;\r\n        val = b.val;\r\n    }\r\n    no_move& operator=(const no_move& b) {\r\n        std::cout << \"Copy assignment operator called\" << std::endl;\r\n        val = b.val;\r\n        return *this;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* if you uncomment these explicit declarations of the move constructor/assignment\r\n       they will be invoked. \r\n    */\r\n    // no_move(no_move&& b) = default;\r\n    // no_move& operator=(no_move&& b) = default;\r\n\r\n};\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char** argv)\r\n{\r\n    no_move a{1};\r\n    no_move b{2};\r\n    no_move c{3};\r\n\r\n    no_move temp{std::move(a)};\r\n    a = std::move(b);\r\n    b = std::move(c);\r\n    c = std::move(temp);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```console\r\nCopy Constructor called\r\nCopy assignment operator called\r\nCopy assignment operator called\r\nCopy assignment operator called\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nBut, on second thought, since `base_uint` is just trivially copyable data, i.e. there are no external resources to be moved, the move constructor won't do anything differently than the copy constructor. There is even a clang-tidy rule that checks for this since it has no effect: https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/performance/move-const-arg.html#cmdoption-arg-CheckTriviallyCopyableMove so this can be left as-is.\r\n\r\nAs-is I think the class kind of violates the rule of three (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three.html), not a big deal but that could be fixed by making the constructor default, but probably not worth a follow-up.
