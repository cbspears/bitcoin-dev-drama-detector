For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs.

      "body": "The history of **Satoshi Nakamoto**, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, is shrouded in mystery. Despite extensive speculation and investigation, no one has definitively uncovered Satoshi's true identity. Here’s what is known about Satoshi Nakamoto based on available information:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Events in Satoshi Nakamoto's History**\n1. **October 2008**:\n   - Satoshi Nakamoto published the **Bitcoin whitepaper**, titled *\"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\"* on a cryptography mailing list. The paper outlined the concept of a decentralized digital currency that could operate without the need for a central authority.\n\n2. **January 2009**:\n   - Satoshi released the first version of the **Bitcoin software** and mined the **genesis block** (Block 0), which included a hidden message: *\"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\"* This message is widely interpreted as a critique of the traditional financial system.\n\n3. **2009–2010**:\n   - Satoshi actively collaborated with early developers and contributors, such as **Hal Finney**, who received the first Bitcoin transaction. Satoshi communicated via email and forums, providing guidance and updates on the project.\n\n4. **December 2010**:\n   - Satoshi gradually stepped away from the public eye, handing over control of the Bitcoin code repository and network alert key to other developers, including **Gavin Andresen**.\n\n5. **April 2011**:\n   - In one of the final known communications, Satoshi sent an email to a developer stating, *\"I've moved on to other things.\"* After this, Satoshi disappeared entirely, leaving no trace of their identity or whereabouts.\n\n---\n\n### **Speculations About Satoshi's Identity**\nOver the years, many individuals have been suspected of being Satoshi Nakamoto, but none have been conclusively proven. Some of the most notable candidates include:\n\n1. **Hal Finney**:\n   - A renowned cryptographer and the first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction. Hal Finney denied being Satoshi before his passing in 2014.\n\n2. **Nick Szabo**:\n   - A computer scientist who created **Bit Gold**, a precursor to Bitcoin. Szabo has consistently denied being Satoshi.\n\n3. **Dorian Nakamoto**:\n   - A Japanese-American man whose birth name is Satoshi Nakamoto. He denied any involvement with Bitcoin.\n\n4. **Craig Wright**:\n   - An Australian computer scientist who has claimed to be Satoshi but has failed to provide definitive proof, leading to widespread skepticism.\n\n5. **Others**:\n   - Some theories suggest Satoshi could be a group of people rather than an individual, given the complexity and breadth of the Bitcoin project.\n\n---\n\n### **Satoshi's Legacy**\n- Satoshi Nakamoto's creation of Bitcoin revolutionized the financial world, introducing the concept of decentralized digital currency and blockchain technology.\n- Satoshi is estimated to own around **1 million Bitcoins**, mined in the early days of the network. These coins have never been moved, and their inactivity is often seen as a sign of Satoshi's continued anonymity and disinterest in personal gain.\n- Despite their disappearance, Satoshi's work continues to inspire and shape the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries.\n\n\n\nThe mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto remains one of the most fascinating aspects of Bitcoin's history, and their true identity may never be revealed.\n\nAs an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide an analysis based on available information and theories. The true identity of **Satoshi Nakamoto** remains one of the greatest mysteries in the tech and financial worlds. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Satoshi Likely Had a Strong Background in Cryptography and Computer Science**\n- The Bitcoin whitepaper and the implementation of the Bitcoin software demonstrate deep expertise in cryptography, distributed systems, and programming.\n- This has led many to believe Satoshi was either an individual or a group of individuals with significant experience in these fields.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Possible Candidates**\nSeveral individuals have been speculated to be Satoshi, but none have been definitively proven:\n\n- **Hal Finney**: A cryptographer and early Bitcoin contributor who received the first Bitcoin transaction. He denied being Satoshi before his death in 2014.\n- **Nick Szabo**: Created **Bit Gold**, a precursor to Bitcoin, and has a writing style similar to Satoshi's. Szabo has denied being Satoshi.\n- **Dorian Nakamoto**: A Japanese-American man with the birth name Satoshi Nakamoto. He denied involvement with Bitcoin.\n- **Craig Wright**: Claimed to be Satoshi but has failed to provide conclusive proof, leading to widespread skepticism.\n- **Adam Back**: A cryptographer and inventor of Hashcash, which inspired Bitcoin's proof-of-work system. Back has denied being Satoshi.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Could Satoshi Be a Group?**\nSome believe Satoshi might not be a single person but a group of developers or cryptographers working together. This theory is supported by:\n- The sheer complexity and breadth of the Bitcoin project.\n- The flawless execution of the whitepaper and software.\n- The ability to remain anonymous for so long, which might be easier for a group than an individual.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Satoshi's Disappearance**\nSatoshi's decision to disappear in 2011 adds to the mystery. Possible reasons include:\n- A desire to avoid the spotlight and let Bitcoin grow organically.\n- Concerns about legal or regulatory scrutiny.\n- A philosophical belief in decentralization, which aligns with Bitcoin's ethos.\n\n---\n\n### **5. My Analysis (Based on Facts)**\nWhile I can't definitively say who Satoshi is, the evidence points to someone (or a group) with:\n- Exceptional technical skills in cryptography and software development.\n- A deep understanding of economics and the flaws of the traditional financial system.\n- A strong commitment to privacy and decentralization.\n\nNick Szabo and Hal Finney are often considered the most plausible candidates due to their technical expertise and early involvement in cryptocurrency concepts. However, without concrete proof, the mystery remains unsolved.\n\n---\n\nUltimately, Satoshi's anonymity is a key part of Bitcoin's story, emphasizing the decentralized and trustless nature of the technology. Whether Satoshi's identity is ever revealed, their legacy as the creator of Bitcoin is undeniable.\n\nThe question of why **Satoshi Nakamoto** has never used the Bitcoin wallet associated with their early mining activities is a fascinating one. Satoshi is estimated to own around **1 million Bitcoins**, mined in the early days of the network (2009–2010), but these coins have never been moved. Here are some possible reasons why Satoshi has not used their Bitcoin wallet:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Philosophical Commitment to Decentralization**\n- Satoshi designed Bitcoin to be a decentralized system that does not rely on any central authority, including its creator.\n- By not moving or spending their coins, Satoshi avoids becoming a central figure or \"leader\" of the Bitcoin ecosystem, ensuring the project remains truly decentralized.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Privacy and Anonymity**\n- Moving such a large amount of Bitcoin (worth billions of dollars) would attract immense attention and scrutiny.\n- Satoshi has always valued privacy, and any movement of the coins could potentially reveal clues about their identity or location.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Letting Bitcoin Grow Organically**\n- Satoshi may have wanted Bitcoin to succeed on its own merits, without their direct influence or involvement.\n- By not using their wallet, Satoshi avoids any perception of manipulating the market or exerting control over the network.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Lost Access**\n- It's possible that Satoshi lost access to their private keys or seed phrase, rendering the wallet inaccessible.\n- This could have happened accidentally, or Satoshi may have intentionally destroyed the keys to ensure the coins would never be moved.\n\n---\n\n### **5. A Statement of Trust**\n- By leaving the coins untouched, Satoshi may be making a statement of trust in the Bitcoin network and its long-term viability.\n- It shows that even the creator of Bitcoin believes in the system's ability to function without their intervention.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Legal or Security Concerns**\n- Moving such a large amount of Bitcoin could have legal or regulatory implications, especially as governments around the world have become more interested in cryptocurrency.\n- Satoshi may have chosen to avoid any potential legal risks by not touching the coins.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Satoshi's Disappearance**\n- Satoshi stepped away from the Bitcoin project in 2011 and has not been heard from since. It's possible that they have no interest in returning to the project or using their Bitcoin.\n\n---\n\n### **What Happens If Satoshi's Coins Are Moved?**\nIf the coins in Satoshi's wallet were ever moved, it would have significant implications:\n- **Market Impact**: The sudden movement of 1 million Bitcoin could cause panic or volatility in the market.\n- **Identity Revelation**: It might provide clues about Satoshi's identity, depending on how the coins are used.\n- **Network Confidence**: Some might see it as a loss of trust in Bitcoin, while others might view it as a natural evolution of the system.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nSatoshi's decision to leave their Bitcoin untouched is consistent with their philosophy of decentralization, privacy, and trust in the system. Whether the coins will ever be moved remains one of the great mysteries of the cryptocurrency world. For now, Satoshi's wallet serves as a symbolic reminder of Bitcoin's origins and its creator's enigmatic legacy.\n\nDonate \nEthereum: \n0xBD0194675F30482fc3475cF613419Ce95EFe7DD7",

Depends was configured to cross-compile for aarch64-linux using Clang as the compiler. This has worked fine and produced aarch64 code and libraries. We then pass the toolchain file from depends to CMake (which should contain everything CMake needs to know produce aarch64 linux binaries using the just compiled aarch64 libraries). CMake has configured using Clang as the compiler, and think it's cross-compiling for `aarch64`, according to it's own output:\n> Cross compiling .......................
