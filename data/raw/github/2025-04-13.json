      "body": "Part of #30289. Builds on top of #31553.\r\n\r\nSo far, the `TxGraph::DoWork()` function took no parameters, and just made all clusters reach the \"acceptable\" internal quality level by performing a minimum number of improvement iterations on it, but:\r\n* Did not attempt to go beyond that.\r\n* Was broken, as the QualityLevel of optimal clusters that merge together was not being reset.\r\n\r\nFix this by adding an argument to `DoWork()` to control how much work it is allowed to do right now, which will first be used to get all clusters to the acceptable level, and if more budget remains, use it to try to get some or all clusters optimal. The function will now return `true` if all clusters are known to be optimal (and thus no further work remains). This is verified in the tests, by remembering whether the graph is optimal, and if it is at the end of the simulation run, verify that the overall linearization cannot be improved further.",

I also cant find genesis.cpp.\n\nIn v24 and above, however, the actual definition of `CreateGenesisBlock()` seems to have been moved, and the `chainparams.cpp` file now simply calls the function without any visible reference to its parameters or where it's defined.\n\n### Request:\nCould you kindly clarify:\n- Where exactly is `CreateGenesisBlock()` now defined in v24 to 28.1?\n- What’s the recommended way to customize the genesis block in this modularized structure?\n- Should one now modify `src/block/genesis.cpp` or another component?\n\n### Context:\nThis would be very helpful for developers building forks for research, education, or alternative chain use cases.\n\nThanks in advance for your time, guidance, and for maintaining such a well-structured and evolving codebase.\n\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nIn the file Chainparams.cpp and chainparams.h, the genesis parameter was supposed to be there which is not there. Without this the genesis token cannot be generated.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIn the SRC folder, find chainparams.cpp file, open the file and search for genesis parameter.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nV24\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 22.\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
