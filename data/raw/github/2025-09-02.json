      "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nUpdate `doc/multisig-tutorial.md` to use multipath descriptor format  \r\ninstead of separate external/internal descriptors. The tutorial now:\r\n\r\n- extracts a single `xpub_n` per participant\r\n- constructs a multipath `wsh(sortedmulti(...))` descriptor with `<0;1>`  \r\n  change index semantics\r\n- uses `getdescriptorinfo` to compute descriptor checksum\r\n- explains that `importdescriptors` expands the multipath descriptor  \r\n  into internal and external descriptors\r\n- update `/test/functional/wallet_multisig_descriptor_psbt.py` functional test / documentation to use multi-path descriptors\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nA single multipath descriptor is the most convenient pattern for multisig; our documentation should use it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### What changed\r\n\r\n- replaced extraction of `external_xpub_n` and `internal_xpub_n` with  \r\n  extraction of a single `xpub_n`\r\n- removed instructions to create and import separate external/internal  \r\n  descriptors\r\n- added instructions to build a multipath `wsh(sortedmulti(...))`  \r\n  descriptor and derive checksum with `getdescriptorinfo`\r\n- checksum field is parsed and appended as the multipath descriptor is not the canonical \"desc\" output\r\n- clarified that `importdescriptors` automatically expands multipath  \r\n  descriptors into internal and external forms\r\n- similar changes to the functional test: wallet_multisig_descriptor_psbt.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI have run the updated shell snippets and confirmed the multipath descriptor produces the same `listdescriptors` output after importing as the two descriptor method in bitcoin:master.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Related issues / PRs\r\n\r\nThis tutorial change references the multipath descriptor\r\nconsolidation (see commit / PR referenced in the change). The commit\r\nmessage points to bitcoin#22838 as the upstream change that enables\r\nthis behavior.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Release note (for changelog)\r\n\r\nDocumentation: update multisig tutorial and multisig functional test to use multipath descriptors",

      "body": "Disable `clang-analyzer-core.UndefinedBinaryOperatorResult` warning because it produces a false positive in a Cap'n Proto header:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n/usr/include/kj/async-inl.h:609:37: warning: The left operand of '+' is a garbage value [clang-analyzer-core.UndefinedBinaryOperatorResult]\r\n  609 |       return *(void**)(*(char**)obj + voff);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was reported by fanquake in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33256 and was previously addressed in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/184/commits/76313450c2c4aa70cf5c443dc2b33c621a565fb5 which changed the analyzer result to be a warning instead of an error. PR https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/pull/2334 was also merged upstream to prevent this in future versions of Cap'n Proto.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it does not seem possible suppress the false-positive warning from this header without turning off the check for bitcoin code as well. The header is included with `-isystem` so it is treated as a third party header, but clang-tidy has a longstanding issue discussed in https://reviews.llvm.org/D26418 where it ignores `-isystem` and ignores `HeaderFilterRegex` and `ExcludeHeaderFilterRegex` directives if it decides that errors are associated with the \"main file\" of the translation unit, which is the case here. (See `isInMainFile` in https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/91400/files)\r\n\r\nThe tidy error is a false positive from clang-analyzer (https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/) warning that the vtable pointer `*(char**)obj` is a garbage value rather than a valid memory address. The analyzer has no way of knowing it could be a valid address since it's only valid due to assumptions about the ABI.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the code is to get a starting function address that can be passed to addr2line from a lambda or function object. The function `GetFunctorStartAddress` calls a helper `PtmfHelper::apply` to get the starting function address from a pointer-to-member-function value pointing at the operator() method. The helper needs to handle virtual methods, so it checks if the pointer is virtual by testing its low-order bit, and if set, assumes the first bytes of the object are a vtable pointer, and does pointer arithmetic with the vtable address. Clang-tidy complains about this because it does not know the vtable address is valid, assuming incorrectly it is a \"garbage value\".\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).",
