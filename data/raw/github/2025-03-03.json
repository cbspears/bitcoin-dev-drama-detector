Because when it comes to a proposed network with the premine of 10.5 million coins, then signet is pretty much already there. It was deployed in 2020, and it is beyond the first halving. Most coins are owned by developers, and there are faucets, where people can mine signet coins on CPUs.\n\nSo, is there anything, where testnet5 would do a better job, than signet with Proof of Work faucets? It may be worth considering selling some coinbase transactions, or things like that for signet coins (like: you pay 25 sBTC or more, and signet creators will allow you to produce a custom block or something). But in general, if it is only about testing mining, then faucet pretty much covers it.",
