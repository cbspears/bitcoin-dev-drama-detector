      "body": "This is a small follow-up for #32941 (commit 1384dbaf6d0bfcdb05f97e1e3cb3d5e498bee505), removing the `-maxorphantx` option completely, now that v30 has been released. If removing it for v31 is seen as controversial/premature (I personally don't think it is), the merge can be delayed for a future release.",

This could be misleading about usage for other greppers. As I was looking, I also noticed a missing `LIFETIMEBOUND` on `BlockManager::GetFirstBlock`. While looking more closely at that method, it should return a reference instead of a pointer. The only reason to return a pointer is if it can be null.",
