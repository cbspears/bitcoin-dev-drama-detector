Doubling the timeout should be sufficient to lower the probability drastically.\r\n\r\n2.) The subtest `test_notfound_on_unannounced_tx` has some (w)txid confusion: we send a `MSG_TX`-type getdata with a `wtxid` in it, which necessarily always results in a NOTFOUND. Fixed this, and change the subtest to be more deterministic based on `mocktime`.",

Also the flag could not be added or removed later.\r\n\r\nThe constraints aren't a problem for the main supported and documented use case of connecting a single hardware wallet and using it just like a normal single sig Bitcoin Core wallet.\r\n\r\nBut they get in the way of more advanced constructions, which are becoming increasingly practical especially once MuSig2 support lands with #29675. See https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/91 and https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/pull/794 for a collection of changes on top of that which facilitate MuSig2 with a hardware wallet. And see #24861.\r\n\r\nThis pull requests drops the following constraints:\r\n\r\n- `disable_private_keys` is no longer mandatory (but still default)\r\n- `external_signer` flag is now mutable\r\n\r\nAdditionally it does the following:\r\n\r\n- make the `blank` option for `createwallet` consistent with regular wallets by _not_ importing keys from the connected signer\r\n- avoid going through `createTransaction` for external signers (otherwise the GUI breaks)\r\n- update `external-signer.md` mainly to use named arguments and point out a GUI setting\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should no noticeable effect on the default single sig use case described above.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
