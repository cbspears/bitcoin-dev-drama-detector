      "body": "Remove `Chain::getTipLocator`, `Chain::GetLocator()`, and `Chain::getActiveChainLocator`:\r\n- `Chain::getTipLocator` is no longer used.\r\n- `Chain::GetLocator`, replaced its call by `GetLocator()`, which uses `LocatorEntries`, avoiding direct access to the chain itself (change suggested by l0rinc while reviewing this PR to maintain consistency with the overall refactoring).\r\n- `Chain::getActiveChainLocator`, whose name was misleading, has functionality redundant with Chain::findBlock.\r\n  - Additionally, the comment for getActiveChainLocator became inaccurate following changes in commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ed470940cddbeb40425960d51cefeec4948febe4 (from PR #25717).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a [follow-up](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29652#issuecomment-3151665095) to #29652.",
