      "body": "As per [recent bitcoindev mailing list discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/d6ZO7gXGYbQ).\r\n\r\nAlso removes the code to enforce those limits, including the `-datacarrier` and `-datacarriersize` config options.\r\n\r\nThese limits are easily bypassed by both direct submission to miner mempools (e.g. MARA Slipstream), and forks of Bitcoin Core that do not enforce them (e.g. Libre Relay). Secondly, protocols are bypassing them by simply publishing data in other ways, such as unspendable outputs and scriptsigs.\r\n\r\nThe *form* of datacarrier outputs remains standardized: a single OP_Return followed by zero or more data pushes; non-data opcodes remain non-standard.\r\n\r\nCC: sipa darosior ",
