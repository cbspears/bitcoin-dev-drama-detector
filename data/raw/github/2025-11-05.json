      "body": "This PR exposes the consensus-level `CheckTransaction` function through the libbitcoinkernel C API and adds a corresponding C++ wrapper.\r\n\r\nCurrently, libkernel only provided script-level validation via `btck_script_pubkey_verify` and `ScriptPubkeyApi<>::Verify`. \r\n\r\nAFAIK there was no way to perform context-free consensus checks on a transaction’s structure (e.g., coinbase rules, money-range, duplicate inputs).\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a new API:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint btck_check_transaction(const btck_Transaction* tx, btck_TxValidationState** out_state);\r\n```\r\n\r\nand a C++ convenience wrapper:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstd::pair<bool, TxValidationState> btck::CheckTransaction(const Transaction& tx);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth follow the ownership and error-handling conventions established in `bitcoinkernel.h`.\r\n\r\nThe test suite is extended with cases covering:\r\n* coinbase scriptSig length bounds\r\n* empty vin / vout detection\r\n* negative or out-of-range output values\r\n* duplicate inputs\r\n* null prevouts in non-coinbase transactions\r\n\r\n",

However, I don't see this in the functional test, which are single-threaded, or at most double threaded?\r\n\r\nI'd say we should just require the GIL for all Python code.

So, when we receive the `VERSION` message, its handling (inside the `if (msg_type == NetMsgType::VERSION) {`) currently goes like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (...)\r\n    A\r\nif (...)\r\n    MakeAndPushMessage()\r\nif (...)\r\n    B\r\nif (...)\r\n    MakeAndPushMessage()\r\nif (...)\r\n    some stuff that better be avoided for private broadcast connections\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor private broadcast we don't want to push any extra messages. To do that I took the approach to reorder the code like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (...)\r\n    A\r\nif (...)\r\n    B\r\n\r\nif this is private broadcast connection // newly added condition\r\n    return, end here\r\n\r\nif (...)\r\n    MakeAndPushMessage()\r\nif (...)\r\n    MakeAndPushMessage()\r\nif (...)\r\n    some stuff that better be avoided for private broadcast connections\r\n```\r\nanother option would be to add \"is private broadcast\" check on every of the `if`s, like:\r\n```\r\nif (...)\r\n    A\r\nif (... and not private broadcast)\r\n    MakeAndPushMessage()\r\nif (...)\r\n    B\r\nif (... and not private broadcast)\r\n    MakeAndPushMessage()\r\nif (... and not private broadcast)\r\n    some stuff that better be avoided for private broadcast connections\r\n```\r\nor something else? I guess this can be achieved in more than one way. No strong opinion, the aim is to avoid calling some of the code.\r\n\r\nBtw, `MakeAndPushMessage()` calls `CConnman::PushMessage()` which ignores messages other than the needed ones for private broadcast connections.",
