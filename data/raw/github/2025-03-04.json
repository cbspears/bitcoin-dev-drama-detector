      "title": "cmake: Avoid fuzzer \"multiple definition of `main'\" errors",
      "body": "This change builds libraries with `-fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link` instead of `-fsanitize=fuzzer` when the cmake `-DSANITIZERS=fuzzer` option is specified. This is necessary to make fuzzing and IPC cmake options compatible with each other and avoid CI failures in #30975 which enables IPC in the fuzzer CI build:\r\n\r\nhttps://cirrus-ci.com/task/5366255504326656?logs=ci#L2817\r\nhttps://cirrus-ci.com/task/5233064575500288?logs=ci#L2384\r\n\r\nThe failures can also be reproduced by checking out #31741 and building with `cmake -B build -DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING=ON -DSANITIZERS=fuzzer -DENABLE_IPC=ON` with this fix reverted.\r\n\r\nThe fix updates the cmake build so when `-DSANITIZERS=fuzzer` is specified, the fuzz test binary is built with `-fsanitize=fuzzer` (so it can use libFuzzer's main function), and libraries are built with `-fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link` (so they can be linked into other executables with their own main functions).\r\n\r\nPreviously when `-DSANITIZERS=fuzzer` was specified, `-fsanitize=fuzzer` was applied to ALL libraries and executables. This was inappropriate because it made it impossible to build any executables other than the fuzz test executable without triggering link errors:\r\n\r\n- `` multiple definition of `main' ``\r\n- `` \"undefined reference to `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput' ``\r\n\r\nif they depended on any libraries instrumented for fuzzing.\r\n\r\nThis was especially a problem when the `ENABLE_IPC` option was set because it made building the `mpgen` code generator impossible so nothing else that depended on generated sources, including the fuzz test binary, could be built either.\r\n\r\nThis commit was previously part of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31741 and had some discussion there starting in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31741#pullrequestreview-2619682385\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).",

But a followup PR #30975 does enable IPC in the fuzzing CI configuration for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- To test ENABLE_IPC option in different scenarios and uncover incompatibilities like this\r\n- To make the fuzz configuration more similar to an eventual default configuration, since a goal after #31741 is to enable ipc by default.\r\n- To make it possible to write fuzz tests covering IPC serialization code. This could involve writing new tests or just changing setup of existing tests. For example with #29409, [`FuzzedWallet`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8cb6ab0b971a27ba255ad6a48959a8c7b84c00f3/src/test/fuzz/util/wallet.h#L23) could be passed an IPC chain interface instead of a local one.",

I didn't notice the FUZZ_LIBS variable, but logically it also makes sense for that to be part of the `fuzzer_interface` target not `core_interface` target. Latest push should move it, though even without this change I think the oss-fuzz build would be ok since it is [not enabling ipc](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/ceb9cf607fbfd9def9ec706b748879d4d493a7e4/projects/bitcoin-core/build.sh#L68-L75) \r\n\r\n> Could we instead opt to not build `mpgen` with any instrumentation? Iiuc we're not interested in fuzzing `mpgen` itself.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible, but there would be complications because mpgen depends on a the libmultiprocess library which should be built with fuzzing options and should possible to fuzz. A workaround like building two copies of the library with and without fuzzing options would would be technically possible, but I don't see a reason to implement a workaround like this. I think an approach where the build provides a `fuzzer_interface` target to contain fuzz linker flags is strictly better than adding fuzz linker flags to the `core_interface` target where they will be applied to all binaries including ones that are not fuzz tests.",

I don't know if we can create an hygienic commit using [scripted-diffs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#scripted-diffs).\r\n* Evaluate alternative testing frameworks, such as Catch2\r\n* Complete the code migration (currently only some tests have been refactored)",

I understand that hebasto, fanquake & others have put time into carrying over Boost.Test from autotools into CMake recently, so not eager to have that work replaced. Getting Boost out of the production code is a higher priority than getting it out of test code, but I still think it is valid to work on.\r\n\r\n> Right, but still valid if test_bitcoin is run directly, for instance because you need to provide custom parameters or execute only specific tests.\r\n\r\nOne can use `ctest ... -R pattern` to filter tests and I've only passed something resembling parameters to unit tests when setting the `RANDOM_CTX_SEED` environment variable. But yeah, I can see how ctest might make test_bitcoin threadsafe in an artificial way.\r\n\r\n> Don't know about NixOS. On Debian the packages required are libgtest-dev and libgmock-dev.

This avoids complexity in IPC code for handling the latter struct.\r\n\r\nThe new Mining interface method is used in `miner_tests`.\r\n\r\nIt's not used by the `getblocktemplate` and `generateblock` RPC calls, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31981#discussion_r2096473337\r\n\r\nThe `inconclusive-not-best-prevblk` check is moved from RPC\r\ncode to `TestBlockValidity`.\r\n\r\nTest coverage is increased by `mining_template_verification.py`.\r\n\r\nSuperseedes #31564\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n### Verifying block templates (no PoW)\r\n\r\nStratum v2 allows miners to generate their own block template. Pools may wish (or need) to verify these templates. This typically involves comparing mempools, asking miners to providing missing transactions and then reconstructing the proposed block.[^0] This is not sufficient to ensure a proposed block is actually valid. In some schemes miners could take advantage of incomplete validation[^1].\r\n\r\nThe Stratum Reference Implementation (SRI), currently the only Stratum v2 implementation, collects all missing mempool transactions, but does not yet fully verify the block.[^2]. It could use the `getblocktemplate` RPC in `proposal` mode, but using IPC is more performant, as it avoids serialising up to 4 MB of transaction data as JSON.\r\n\r\n(although SRI could use this PR, the Template Provider role doesn't need it, so this is _not_ part of #31098)\r\n\r\n[^0]: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/06-Job-Declaration-Protocol.md  \r\n[^1]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/pplns-with-job-declaration/1099/45?u=sjors\r\n[^2]: https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/blob/v1.1.0/roles/jd-server/src/lib/job_declarator/message_handler.rs#L196\r\n",
