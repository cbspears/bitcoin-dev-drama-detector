      "body": "Note: There is an alternative change that turns `-asmap` into a bool option and adds a `-asmapfile` option: #33631 Please indicate with your conceptual review which option you prefer, thanks!\r\n\r\nThis changes the behavior of the `GetPathArg` function to better work with the behavior of `-asmap`. When a path arg is given \"1\" (for example -asmap=1), this would currently be interpreted as a path but should be interpreted as using the arg without a parameter which activates the fallback. There is no explicit test added here because this is tested implicitly in the tests added in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28792.\r\n\r\nAlso improves the documentation of the `-asmap` default behavior.\r\n\r\nSee #33386 for further discussion.

      "body": "Note: There is an alternative change that leaves the behavior of `-asmap` as is but makes slight improvements and adds better documentation: #33632 Please indicate with your conceptual review which option you prefer, thanks!\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new option `-asmapfile` which allows to set the asmap file, while `-asmap` now is simply a bool option. Also fixes the asmap functional test docs, since then had become out of sync with the actual content of the test.\r\n\r\nThe current handling of `-asmap` is a bit confusing and atypical of our usual options behavior. The `-asmap` option can be used as a boolean which turns on the feature and looks for the file in the default location. But it can be alternatively be used to pass a path to a file which is not in the default location, which also turns on the feature implicitly.\r\n\r\nSee #33386 for further discussion.

For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.",

Makes sense to me \r\n\r\n<details><summary>(EDIT: can just be in a followup)</summary>\r\nbut I think we can just use the existing wrapper, `AcceptSubPackage`? https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/tree/2025-10-mempoolaccept-layers\r\n\r\nIt gives us these layers of `MemPoolAccept` functions:\r\n- 1 narrow public-facing interface for validating any number of transactions, `AcceptPackage`. It handles subpackaging and dispatches to the other functions.\r\n    - On master, this function is already able to handle a package of size 1.\r\n    - This is the only function that acquires any locks; everything below needs to already have it held.\r\n- The `AcceptSubPackage` wrapper, which handles cleaning up `SubPackageState`. It requires locks to already be held. Everything goes through this wrapper to be submitted.\r\n- `AcceptSingleTransaction` and `AcceptMultipleTransactions`, which each run a set of comprehensive checks for their respective categories. Sometimes they are given \"subpackages\" of a larger package, so they can be using a dirty `m_view`. However, they can expect a clean `SubPackageState`.\r\n- The internal helpers that apply some subset of validation rules: `PreChecks`, `ReplacementChecks`, `PackageMempoolChecks`, *ScriptChecks`, and the submission helpers`FinalizeSubpackage` and `SubmitPackage`. They usually work on `Workspace`s and `SubPackageState`s that have been modified by each other.\r\n\r\nIt also consolidates the public interface. There are currently 3 ways to use `MemPoolAccept`:\r\n(1) Single tx, test_accept or not\r\n(2) Multi-tx test_accept\r\n(3) Package, not test_accept, restricted to child-with-parents package\r\n\r\n(3) also accepts packages of size 1, but the api is slightly different and should be made consistent. (2) and (3) are separate right now because they have different requirements and results (we can't just reuse it with `test_accept=true`). But after cluster mempool, we can unify them by improving the subchunking in `AcceptPackage`. TLDR I think they should all route through 1 function.\r\n</details>",

          "body": "@instagibbs After discussing this offline with @sdaftuar, I think the complexity here is due to the combination of a number of requirements:\r\n* We want to bound the latency of a single `TxGraph::DoWork()` invocation (to something in the order of milliseconds).\r\n* We want to bound what percentage of CPU time in total is spent by `TxGraph`'s linearization efforts (inside `DoWork()`, or elsewhere), over long periods of time.\r\n* In practice get everything optimal.\r\n\r\nThe current code, which sets `POST_CHANGE_WORK = 100 * ACCEPTABLE_ITERS` only considers the first requirement, but risks spending a huge percentage of time on linearization, if the graph somehow contains one or more clusters which make no progress towards being optimal within `100 * ACCEPTABLE_ITERS` work.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to also address the second requirement by reducing `POST_CHANGE_WORK`, e.g. to `1 * ACCEPTABLE_ITERS`, but this worsens the situation for the 3rd requirement. Ironically, if a reduction here results in a state where we end up with permanently non-optimal clusters, a reduction may increase overall CPU time spent on linearization even (because it may mean retrying to linearize the same cluster over and over again).\r\n\r\nWith SFL, this is probably much less a concern in practice to set the value somewhat higher, because it's much more incremental (starting with a better linearization means less additional work to find optimal) and just needs much less work in the worst case. `5 * ACCEPTABLE_ITERS` (if `ACCEPTABLE_ITERS` in an SFL world is scaled to ~50 μs) is likely sufficient to eventually get everything optimal, after a few attempts at least.\r\n\r\nA more robust solution for all concerns at once I think is making the argument to `DoWork()` dynamic:\r\n* The mempool keeps track of a longer-term linearization budget `m_linearization_budget`, which is incremented with every transaction/block/reorg/...\r\n* Work is done with `DoWork(std::min(m_linearization_budget, 100 * ACCEPTABLE_ITERS))`, and followed by subtracting how much work was actually performed from `m_linearization_budget`.\r\n\r\nBut post-SFL, this may be overkill.",

          "body": "Just repushed this branch with `POST_CHANGE_WORK` reduced to `5 * ACCEPTABLE_ITERS`.  I gathered some simulation data (by replaying transactions/blocks that my datalogger recorded in 2023) in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/sdaftuar/77d4e67d0b5e1ef59e6d2ecf4d43484e), if anyone is curious about the benchmarks I was looking at.\r\n\r\nThe main piece of information to consider is that in November and December 2023, there were clusters that CSS had trouble linearizing, and so the 99th percentile of DoWork() runtimes (with `POST_CHANGE_WORK` set to `100 * ACCEPTABLE_ITERS`) shot up to 9ms, as on every transaction added to the mempool we'd spend `100*ACCEPTABLE_ITERS` work trying (in vain) to optimally linearize the difficult clusters.  This makes the amount of CPU we'd use in normal transaction processing much higher than before (as the average accepted transaction otherwise would take very little time for us to process).\r\n\r\nThe tradeoff with reducing the work limit passed to `DoWork()` is that clusters are suboptimal more often, so I measured that as well and posted those results in the gist.  However, the results are still quite good overall, and the overall time spent processing transactions (including at the tails) is not greatly affected by setting the work limit to `5 * ACCEPTABLE_ITERS`.  So I think this is good enough for now, and after SFL the runtime numbers will get much better (and everything we've ever seen can be optimally linearized pretty quickly).",

The options documented vary based on build system settings, but the manual pages checked into the repository should document as many options as possible.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nThis PR adds comprehensive build option detection to ensure all available options are documented in the generated manpages.\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\n- **Added build option detection** for all required components:\r\n  - `HAVE_SYSTEM` - for `-alertnotify` and other notifications\r\n  - `ENABLE_WALLET` - for wallet specific arguments  \r\n  - `USE_UPNP` - for UPnP arguments\r\n  - `ENABLE_ZMQ` - for ZMQ arguments\r\n  - Additional important build options (`ENABLE_CLI`, `ENABLE_BITCOIN_UTIL`, etc.)\r\n\r\n- **Added `--skip-build-options-check`** flag to bypass validation when needed\r\n- **Improved error handling** with clear messages when components are missing\r\n- **Fixed grammar** in error messages (\"Aborting generation of...\" instead of \"Aborting generating...\")\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n- Checks `HAVE_SYSTEM` from `builddir/src/bitcoin-build-config.h`\r\n- Checks other options from `builddir/test/config.ini` \r\n- Provides clear error messages listing missing components\r\n- Users can rebuild with `./configure --enable-wallet --enable-zmq --with-upnp --enable-external-signer` to enable all options\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Script now prevents generation of incomplete man pages\r\n- Clear error messages guide users to enable missing components\r\n- `--skip-build-options-check` allows bypassing validation when needed\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgments\r\nThis work builds upon the initial implementation by @BrandonOdiwuor in PR #33085, with additional improvements and fixes.

      "title": "Revert OP_RETURN Policy Changes in Bitcoin Core v0.30",
      "body": "**Proposal to Revert OP_RETURN Mempool Policy Relaxation for Enhanced Network Integrity and User Consensus**\n\nI'm a Bitcoin user and node operator requesting a rollback of the OP_RETURN policy changes in Bitcoin Core v0.30. The update increased the data carrier size from 80 bytes to 100,000 bytes, causing concerns about blockchain bloat, spam, legal risks, and Bitcoin's focus as digital cash.\n\n\n## Why Roll Back?\n**Keeps Bitcoin Decentralized:** Large data in transactions bloats the blockchain, making it harder and costlier to run nodes, which hurts decentralization.\n\n**Reduces Spam:** Bigger OP_RETURN limits could flood the network with non-financial data, raising fees and pushing out regular users.\n\n**Avoids Legal Issues:** Storing large data on-chain risks illegal content being added, which could cause legal trouble for node operators.\n\n**Community Support:** Many users on X and Reddit oppose this change. Bitcoin Knots (keeping the 80-byte limit) is gaining node share (~18-20%), showing a community split.\n\nReverting this will show Bitcoin Core listens to users and keeps Bitcoin focused on being secure money.\n\n## How to Roll Back\n\nHere are simple ways to fix this without major changes:\n\n**Reset Default Limit:** In the next release (v0.30.1 or v0.31), set -datacarriersize back to 80 bytes. Revert changes in src/policy/policy.cpp.\n\n**Add a Strict Option:** Create a setting like -strict-opreturn (default: on) to enforce the 80-byte limit unless users opt out.\n\n**Phase It Out:** Gradually lower the limit (e.g., 10,000 bytes in v0.31, then 80 bytes in v0.32) while checking network stats.\n\n**Add Anti-Spam Filters:** Copy Bitcoin Knots and add optional filters for dust or data-heavy transactions.\n\nThese steps keep Bitcoin backward-compatible and respect user choice.\n\n## My Take\n\nPlease understand: we need to code Bitcoin in a way that keeps it **legal** and **doesn't challenge governments**. With huge OP_RETURN limits, there's a real risk of *lots of illegal stuff* (like CSAM, malware, or copyrighted material) being etched on-chain forever. Node operators could face jail time or fines just for running a full node.\n\nBitcoin is used by millions as a **store of value**—not a spam platform or decentralized storage. We **do not want unnecessary spam** flooding the chain and driving up fees.\n\n**We have thousands of altcoins** for NFTs, inscriptions, and data storage. Why turn Bitcoin into another one? What's next—**switching to PoS**? Is *that* the direction we're taking?\n\n\n",
