Since the commit was adding an `nVersion` field to the serialized transaction data anyways, and `nVersion` is 4 bytes, it reused the `fTimeReceivedIsTxTime` field as the `nVersion` field, and changed `fTimeReceivedIsTxTime` to a bool and moved it to the end of tx serialization: \r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/main.h b/main.h\r\nindex 7d1145b5ff..dda5f730c7 100644\r\n\r\n-        READWRITE(fTimeReceivedIsTxTime);\r\n+        READWRITE(nVersion);\r\n+        if (fRead && nVersion < 100)\r\n+            const_cast<CWalletTx*>(this)->fTimeReceivedIsTxTime = nVersion;\r\n         READWRITE(nTimeReceived);\r\n         READWRITE(fFromMe);\r\n         READWRITE(fSpent);\r\n+        if (nVersion >= 31404)\r\n+        {\r\n+            READWRITE(fTimeReceivedIsTxTime);\r\n+            READWRITE(fUnused);\r\n+            READWRITE(strFromAccount);\r\n+        }\r\n     )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis broke transaction times for wallets that were upgraded and then loaded into an older bitcoin client, since these wallets would have giant version numbers like `31404` in the `fTimeReceivedIsTxTime` for every transaction, and `fTimeReceivedIsTxTime` would always be true.\r\n\r\nA later commit (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/865c3a23832e36d50cb873d38c976032b027b5d3) reverted the above change to fix this upgrade-then-downgrade bug, but it had to include a special case for fixing transactions that had very large `fTimeReceivedIsTxTime` that matched the version numbers that were affected by this bug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/482d2553764ef1fa3f9c06389b2e13a735d86eda/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L1033-L1053\r\n\r\nAnd Bitcoin Core retains this special-case handling today, even though, for a *long* time, even before the introduction of smart time in #1393, `GetTxTime()` has not used `fTimeReceivedIsTxTime` (471426fb3b2c2fa37640c0381): \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/471426fb3b2c2fa37640c03819c4f7be69ba8301/src/wallet.cpp#L354-L358\r\n\r\n\r\n[^1]: This snippet is from the initial git commit: 4405b78d6059e536c36",
