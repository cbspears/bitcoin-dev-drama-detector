      "body": "Addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33368#issuecomment-3319935660\r\n\r\nThere is not an explicit check that the to-be-created wallet transaction would be within the {TRUC, normal} ancestor limits. This means that the wallet may create a transaction that violates these limits, but fail to broadcast it in `CommitTransaction`.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be expected behavior for the normal ancestor limits (and any other situation in which the wallet creates a tx that was rejected by mempool) and AFAIK the transaction will be rebroadcast at some point after the ancestors confirm.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1ed00a0d39d5190d8ad88a0dd705a09b56d987aa/test/functional/wallet_basic.py#L502-L506\r\n\r\nIt's a bit complex to address this for the normal ancestor limit, and probably unrealistic for the wallet to check all possible mempool policies in coin selection, but it's quite trivial for TRUC: just skip any unconfirmed UTXOs that have any ancestors. I think it would be much more helpful to the user to say there are insufficient funds.",

I was able to tweak the functional test a bit and get it to also mimic the silent failing behavior in this branch:\r\n https://github.com/monlovesmango/bitcoin/tree/pr33528-functional-test-tweak\r\nI am still trying to figure out the root cause for why it no longer throws an exception when using `send` instead of `sendall` for the second tx, but wanted report back since you might have a much better idea of what is going on.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is that another scenario I had identified and was waiting report to see if first scenario was even an issue was when tx1 has more than one output and wallet tries to send more than one child there is also a silent failure. Seems like this could be fixed by checking that parent doesn't already have a child already? Below is the commands for testing this scenario based on v30 Testing Guide setup.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nTRUC_address1=$(bcli30 getnewaddress)\r\nTRUC_address2=$(bcli30 getnewaddress)\r\ntx=$(bcli30 -named send outputs='{\"'$TRUC_address1'\": 1, \"'$TRUC_address2'\": 2}' fee_rate=25 version=3)\r\nTRUC_address3=$(bcli30 getnewaddress)\r\nTRUC_address4=$(bcli30 getnewaddress)\r\ntx2=$(bcli30 -named send outputs='{\"'$TRUC_address3'\": 0.5}' options='{\"inputs\":[{\"txid\":\"'$(echo $tx|jq -r \".txid\")'\",\"vout\":0}]}' fee_rate=25 version=3)\r\ntx3=$(bcli30 -named send outputs='{\"'$TRUC_address4'\": 0.5}' options='{\"inputs\":[{\"txid\":\"'$(echo $tx|jq -r \".txid\")'\",\"vout\":1}]}' fee_rate=25 version=3)\r\nbcli30 getrawtransaction  $(echo $tx2|jq -r \".txid\") 1\r\nbcli30 getrawtransaction  $(echo $tx3|jq -r \".txid\") 1\r\n```",

This PR is limiting the UTXOs that show up when doing automatic coin selection, and thus errors with \"insufficient funds\" when it can't find enough UTXOs for the tx. In your test/commands, you're pre-selecting those inputs using `send`.\r\n\r\nBtw, when I was testing `send` commands on regtest, I found that sometimes I accidentally succeeded because the wallet had other confirmed UTXOs to spend. You can sanity check that you're indeed failing silently using `with self.nodes[0].assert_debug_log([\"Transaction cannot be broadcast immediately\"])`.\r\n\r\nI think it would be reasonable to stop this transaction from being created and throw a \"invalid parameters\" error, telling the user they selected inputs that can't be spent due to policy. Similar to here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b510893d00760083ac36948747aa6ebd84656192/src/wallet/rpc/spend.cpp#L1511-L1516",

Enabling \"-DLLVM_USE_SANITIZER=Thread\" for libcxx in nix lets me reproduce this. Will make a PR updating the CI job and fixing the bug, once I figure out what the bug is\r\n\r\nEDIT: This turned out not to be true. Building libc++ with -DLLVM_USE_SANITIZER=Thread did trigger tsan errors related to use of stdout, but these are not the same errors happening here. The tsan errors happening here show up when building cap'n proto with -fsanitize=thread and are just caused by a test bug introduced in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/214",
