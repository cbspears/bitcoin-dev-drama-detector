      "body": "We've been moving in the direction that all wallets must have a name. Therefore, we shouldn't allow creating new unnamed wallets. `createwallet`, `restorewallet`, and the wallet tool's `create` and `createfromdump` all now require the user to provide a non-empty wallet name when creating/restoring a wallet.\r\n\r\nThe GUI is already enforcing this, but we were not enforcing it for RPCs or in the underlying `CreateWallet` and `RestoreWallet` functions.\r\n\r\nWallet migration does still need to be able to restore unnamed wallets, so there is a new argument to `RestoreWallet` to explicitly allow that behavior for migration only.",

      "body": "Part of #30289.\r\n\r\nThis was split off from #34023, because it's not really an optimization but a feature. The feature existed pre-SFL, so this brings SFL to parity in terms of functionality with the old code.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that while optimality - as achieved by SFL before this PR - guarantees a linearization whose feerate diagram is optimal, it may be possible to split chunks into smaller equal-feerate parts. This is desirable because even though it doesn't change the diagram, it provides more flexibility for optimization (binpacking is easier when the pieces are smaller).\r\n\r\nThus, this PR introduces the stronger notion of \"minimality\": optimal chunks, which are also split into their smallest possible pieces. To accomplish that, an additional step in the SFL algorithm is added which aims to split chunks into minimal equal-feerate parts where possible, without introducing circular dependencies between them. It works based on the observation that if an (already otherwise optimal) chunk has a way of being split into two equal-feerate parts, and T is a given transaction in the chunk, then we can find the split in two steps:\r\n* One time, pretend T has $\\epsilon$ higher feerate than it really has. If a split exists with T in the top part, this will find it.\r\n* The other time, pretend T has $\\epsilon$ lower feerate than it really has. If a split exists with T in the bottom part, this will find it.\r\n\r\nSo we try both on each found optimal chunk. If neither works, the chunk is minimal. If one works, recurse into the split chunks to split them further.",
