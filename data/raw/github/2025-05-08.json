      "title": "[Policy] Discourage Unsigned Annexes",
      "body": "This patch adds a \"redundant\" rule with the annex discouragement, to discourage Annexes that are present but do not get signed.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not include tests, as the code paths are entirely redundant (and small!) with existing annex discouragement. If desired, tests could be made.\r\n\r\nThis new policy would come into play if someone somewhere for some reason decided that they were going to modify standard policy on their node to allow annexes **even though it is abundantly clear that annex policy should not change until there is a semantic meaning for them** (see the Taproot BIPs for more context), they can leave this lighter policy intact (or add it as a backport if they have already started accepting annexes).\r\n\r\nGiven recent discussion, it seems clear that certain nodes will remove such limitations, and having this code present in core provides an encouragement to retain this safety oriented policy, even if Annexes are desired prematurely.\r\n\r\nAnnexes should be signed because if they are not, certain output types (e.g. and OP_TRUE script in a taproot output, used only as an anchor) would become malleable to third parties, introducing griefing and transaction pinning vectors. If the annexes will come anyways, they must at least be specifically requested under this rule.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b072ffa-2fe3-4345-9e9c-5486d78d1c77)\r\n",

It was pointed out to me that there already exists some Rust code in contrib, so this might be a welcome addition to the toolkit here.\r\n\r\nThis lets you obfuscate the blocks blk.dat and rev.dat files if you synced with a version prior to v28.\r\n\r\nIt checks if a `xor.dat` file exists, and if it is zero it overwrites it with a non-zero random key. It then goes through each `*.dat` file in the blocks directory, checking if the first 4 bytes are the magic bytes. If so it reads the whole file into memory, xors all bytes with the key, then writes to a temporary file. It then renames the temporary file to the dat file it xor'd. This lets users safely run this on any blocks directory, as long as they let it completely finish once before starting bitcoind.",

A script could then work backwards and lower the height. And in that case it might as well be an RPC command.\r\n\r\nI have an idea for a follow-up PR (haven't started implementing yet) which would cause `bitcoind` to, upon opening a block file, look at the first 4 bytes, and if it's MAGIC, then don't xor anything while reading or writing to that file. But if xor-ing with `xor.dat` yields MAGIC, then do the xor when reading or writing the file. That is, make the xor per-file. Since this PR makes each file update atomic (by writing to a temp file then doing a rename, rather than rewriting the file in-place), each file will either be fully xored or not. So I think that would work.\r\n\r\nThat way, one could start this `xor-blocks` tool, interrupt it at any time (for example, suppose you unexpectedly need to use the node immediately), and safely start bitcoind. Later, you can shut down `bitcoind` and restart `xor-blocks` and let it finish. It wouldn't even have to depend on converting the blocks files in order, nor keep track of that separate state (height or block file number), which seems more robust.",

This is done using pointer casting and unsafe dereferencing, so we don't have to copy the data back and forth when converting `[u8; 16]` to `u128`.\r\n- A custom datadir option is now passed as `-datadir=`, similar to `bitcoind`.\r\n- Files are read 16 bytes at a time and the bytes are written to a temporary file immediately after XORing. This substantially reduces memory usage.\r\n- `File::sync_data()` is called before renaming to make the writing atomic.\r\n- The `xor.dat` key file is only written when overwriting a zero key, not every time the program is run. `File::sync_data()` is also called after writing.\r\n- The `rand` crate has been removed in favor of `std::hash::RandomState`.

If you had to service an RPC or p2p request for a block from a pre-xor'd file, you'd have to switch on the fly to xoring vs not. Similar if you got reorged from a block in an xor'd file to not. If you requested a pruned block from a peer and now store it in a newly xor'd file.\r\n\r\nI think all or nothing is a more sane approach for something that should only be a temporary solution (ideally everyone resyncs at some point).\r\n\r\n> Is it possible to add this feature in bitcoin core itself?\r\n\r\n@1440000bytes Yes, I suppose it's possible. It would be similar to how the UTXO db was migrated from per-tx values to per-output. It was a 10 minute or so migration when the UTXO set was much smaller. This tool unfortunately will take a while longer (20 minutes or so on my NVME, many hours for spinning disk drives).\r\n\r\n> I wonder if -reindex could be taught to do this instead.\r\n\r\n@maflcko That would be convenient, but a reindex is a much longer task than this tool.

As the files are closed after mmap, the mmapped files don't take up a file descriptor slot.\r\n- After #30039, the number of ldb files created is 16 times smaller. 1000 files with the new default of 32MB is 32GB of database. Maybe there's nothing left to do here and we can better drop the patch.",

This could lead them to thinking they have the latest security patches.\r\n* Conversely, people setting a fixed, but ancient SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH may think they are running an EOL version, even though they have the latest security release.\r\n* Absent security stuff, the behavior just seems more confusing than before for users.\r\n\r\nI understand that bumping user-facing version numbers and year numbers is boring, but they also serve a purpose. If we don't want that, user-facing version numbers or year numbers should just be removed, but that is probably a larger discussion.\r\n\r\nSo tend toward NACK for now.",
