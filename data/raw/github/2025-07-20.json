      "body": "This contains some commits from #28792 that can be easily reviewed and merged independently. I hope splitting this change off can make this part move a bit faster and reduce frequency of needed rebases for #28792.\r\n\r\nThe commits in order:\r\n- Add additional unit test vectors to the asmap interpreter (written by sipa). This helps to ensure that the further refactors in #28792 don't change behavior. \r\n- Modernizes the logging in `util/asmap.cpp`, I added this while touching the rest of the file all over anyway.\r\n- Adds an `AutoFile::size` helper function with some additional test coverage in a separate commit",

We still do them for a variety of reasons. In this case, I was working on the asmap implementation code for a while and this piece of it always jumped out at me as a layer violation. It seemed like this kind of file handling functionality should live in a helper function in a different part of the code base. So that's what I did. I probably still hadn't done it if there had been no deduplication opportunity at all, but at least there was one. And an additional benefit is having the function also allows for testing of this functionality in isolation.\r\n\r\n> I understand this is listed as \"selected minor preparatory work\", and I realize this is nitpicking a bit, but it would still be cleaner to introduce these changes in a PR where they're actually used or needed, or in a dedicated Streams refactoring PR.

While the impact might be minor it can still help because a lot of people (myself included) have struggled with the review of this code. And direct usage is the usual requirement we have for including refactorings in a feature PR afaict unless things become too big or a separate conceptual discussion is required. I think the extend of this is fine in the in terms of LOC and the other files it touches. So I will not move this out because practically speaking there are now two active and three stale acks here plus there has been prior review of this in #28792. Pulling this out, looking for another PR to include this in or putting it into it's own PR would create too much friction and distract more from moving asmap forward than keeping it here. It's true that we generally want smaller, focussed PRs but we also shouldn't overdo this and in this case I fall on having these changes bundled here is still the best way to go.",

      "body": "Summary:\nA serious coordinated disclosure of a CI/CD vulnerability chain impacting Bitcoin Core trust infrastructure was submitted responsibly, but met with the following:\n\n- Dismissive behavior\n- Public mockery of the researcher\n- False technical claims downplaying CI/CD threat\n- Closure of the GitHub issue without technical evaluation\n\n#### Who was involved:\n- **@achow101 (Ava Chow)** closed the issue without PoC review, discussion, or coordination.\n- **@kanzure (Bryan Bishop)** mocked the disclosure, questioned the researcher's credibility, and injected irrelevant LLM accusations — instead of addressing technical risk.\n\n#### Why this matters:\nBitcoin's strength lies in its **trust chain**. CI/CD is not some optional layer — it’s the heart of review, merge, and verification processes.  \nAny compromise here affects:\n\n- Pre-merge testing\n- Contributor approval paths\n- Verification infrastructure\n- Downstream consumers: wallets, exchanges, custodians\n\nDismissing this is not just technically ignorant — it’s dangerous.\n\n#### Timeline:\n\n- 📅 July 20, 2025 – Initial disclosure sent via `security@bitcoincore.org`\n- 📅 July 20, 2025 – Issue opened on GitHub\n- 📅 Bryan intervenes, dismisses, and mocks the disclosure\n- 📅 Ava closes the issue with \"Completed\" without PoC or review\n- 📅 Still no direct technical contact or secure channel offered\n\n#### Researcher Statement:\n> I disclosed this issue privately and professionally.\n> I expected maturity, not mockery.\n> This post is not for attention — it’s to protect an ecosystem that deserves better gatekeepers.\n\n#### Request:\n- Public acknowledgment of mishandling\n- Re-opening of a secure coordination channel (PGP)\n- Engagement with maintainers who respect ethical disclosure\n\n—  \n**Researcher: Alex Morgan**  \nThis issue will remain public as a case study in how not to respond to critical vulnerabilities. @kanzure @achow101 ",

There was no request for my PGP fingerprint or key because no human has replied to coordinate.\n\nYou keep pushing the narrative that this is about \"believability.\"  \nThis is not a personal trust issue. It's a technical one — and one that's being mishandled publicly because of your repeated interventions.\n\nAccusing someone of using LLMs is your latest deflection. I could have written this with crayons — the content still matters.\n\nIf you truly represent the security team, coordinate professionally.  \nIf you don’t, then kindly stop derailing what was a clean attempt to disclose a major vulnerability through proper channels.\n\nYour involvement has gone from confusing… to obstructive.\n\n– A researcher who’s tired of explaining professionalism to someone who keeps missing the point. @kanzure At this point, the only inconsistency I see is your inability to decide whether you're a reviewer, a gatekeeper, or just someone who doesn’t like not being the smartest person in the room.\n",

The issue reported was a **multi-stage CI/CD supply chain vulnerability**, not a syntax error or user complaint.  \n   Dismissing it without technical review is a breach of every responsible disclosure principle in open source security.\n\n2. The claim that “CI/CD cannot affect release builds” is not only inaccurate — it’s dangerously naive.  \n   CI/CD affects everything *before* deterministic builds:  \n   - Code review gates  \n   - Merge pipelines  \n   - Pre-merge verification  \n   - Contributor trust chain  \n   - Third-party integrations (wallets, exchanges, etc.)\n\n   If CI was irrelevant, adversaries wouldn’t target it. Ask SolarWinds.\n\n3. PGP keys *were* used. No response came from security@bitcoincore.org. That’s not “inconsistency” — it’s silence.\n\n4. Bryan: Mocking responsible disclosure with “LLM” accusations and nitpicking email headers doesn’t make you right — it makes you part of the problem.  \n   Your entire approach has been one of arrogance, not security. You don’t speak for the project, and you certainly don’t speak for the users at risk.\n\n5. Ava: Marking a disclosure like this as “Completed” — without secure coordination, without technical assessment, and without review of the proof — is a cover-up, not a resolution.  \n   If anything, your response will be documented as a failure of process, not an example of it.\n\nSecurity isn’t a checkbox, a GitHub comment, or a title.  \nIt’s how you handle risk *before it explodes*.\n\n– A researcher who offered a chance to fix this quietly. You chose otherwise. @kanzure @achow101 ",
