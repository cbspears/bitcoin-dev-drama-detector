      "title": "Rollback for dumptxoutset without invalidating blocks",
      "body": "This is an alternative approach to implement `dumptxoutset` with rollback that was discussed a few times. It does not rely on `invalidateblock` and `reconsiderblock` and instead creates a temporary copy of the coins DB, modifies this copy by rolling back as many blocks as necessary and then creating the dump from this temp copy DB. See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29553#issuecomment-1978480989, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32817#issuecomment-3012406102 and #29565 discussions.\r\n\r\nThe nice side-effects of this are that forks can not interfere with the rollback and network activity does not have to be suspended. But there are also some downsides when comparing to the current approach: this does require some additional disk space for the copied coins DB and performance is slower (master took 3m 17s vs 9m 16s in my last test with the code here, rolling back ~1500 blocks). However, there is also not much code being added here, network can stay active throughout and performance would stay constant with this approach while it would impact master if there were forks that needed to be invalidated as well (see #33444 for the alternative approach), so this could still be considered a good trade-off.",

[Here](https://github.com/fjahr/bitcoin/commit/a86bbfbd6f0d6e440ff8c5c303e392e51e3eb60b) is the latest one, something is definitely still broken there but the dump it generates is correct. All tests I did had in common that the processing time actually took longer than the current approach, almost 28 min with the latest code version. I am now thinking that longer rollbacks may not be quicker, only shorter ones will be because the big copy overhead in the beginning is saved. But then we also don't have that much to gain. Even if the performance can be improved, now that I have played around with it, it doesn't seem worth the additional code complexity it introduces. It would need to be significantly faster to justify that and I am currently not seeing that.",
