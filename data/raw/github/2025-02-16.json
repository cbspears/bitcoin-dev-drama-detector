          "body": "We are usually using a combination of functional and unit tests and for user facing features like the index which directly changes how `gettxoutsetinfo` works and what results it returns, we definitely need functional tests to check that end to end. Where we draw the line and if it would be appropriate to have some duplication between unit and functional tests is a bigger question and I think there should probably an issue to discuss this with a reference to this PR as an example. I think people prefer unit tests for everything that can be done in unit tests due to the speed. If there are parts of indices that are not tested in either definitely add them as unit tests if they are appropriate, which it sounds like it is in you case @davidgumberg . But I guess I would question if there really isn't a better way to a unit test without exposing more of the interface. Couldn't you drive the test index test through manipulating the test chain and its validation interface in a unit test? I haven't taken a look at this in a long time, just an idea of an approach I would look into.\r\n\r\n> Thanks to their run time, I run the unit tests much more frequently in my local environment than any of the others.\r\n>\r\n> Test size in LOC here isn't too different from the python code.\r\n> \r\n> If I were working on this code, in most cases I think I would rather be repeatedly running coinstatsindex_tests than feature_coinstatsindex.py.\r\n\r\nIMO we need the functional tests for the index for end-to-end testing, so removing the functional test isn't an option. Which means adding this test here as is would create duplication between unit and functional tests. This comes at the expense of the general runtime of the full test suite though. For example, this would slow down the CI which runs the full test suite in most cases. So while it's more comfortable for local development, overall I think the downside is greater than the upside.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to moving things between unit and functional tests, like making the functional tests a bit lighter while adding the same case as a unit test, I am definitely open to that. Would be interesting to look for example of that in the past and how rationale has been laid out there. I would definitely like to see a rationale that lays out how coverage is maintained at the same level after moving test cases from functional to unit tests. But if you can do that I think you can get wide conceptual support for such changes easily because everyone loves a speed up (on all levels) without compromising coverage.",
