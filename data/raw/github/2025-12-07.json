      "body": "This prevents signed integer overflow in `LocalServiceInfo::nScore` by saturating at `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()` in `SeenLocal()`.\r\n\r\nThe `nScore` field could overflow from `INT_MAX` to `INT_MIN` when incremented during version handshakes, causing undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nI implemented saturation in `SeenLocal()` to cap `nScore` at `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()` instead of allowing overflow. This prevents undefined behavior while maintaining memory efficiency - after 2 billion connections, the matter is settled.\r\n\r\n- Added test case `LocalAddress_nScore_Overflow` that verifies saturation behavior\r\n- Test confirms `nScore` remains at max value after multiple `SeenLocal()` calls\r\n\r\nFixes #24049",
