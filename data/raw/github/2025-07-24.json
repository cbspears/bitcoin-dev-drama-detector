      "body": "I tested all of the reported surviving mutants that @brunoerg reported in https://gist.github.com/brunoerg/834063398d5002f738506d741513e310. \r\n\r\nI found that all Mutants except for 12, 14, 17, 37, and 39 were now being caught by one of the existing tests. This fixes Mutants 14, 37, and 39.\r\n\r\nMutant 17 is not fixed, because I consider it acceptable that running BnB for 100,001 instead of 100,000 comparisons doesn’t cause an issue, and Mutant 12 is not yet fixed, because at `fee` = `long_term_fee`, the waste of inputs is 0 and only excess matters, and I haven’t evaluated yet, whether it needs to be fixed.",

The minor verion is enough.\r\n\r\nThis also avoids requiring users to keep a potentially unsafe old\r\npatch version installed.\r\n\r\nThe linter CI job used `python_build` (part of PyEnv) which requires specifying an exact Python version. The first commit changes it to use the higher level `pyenv install` which will pick the most recent patch version it knows about.\r\n\r\nThe original stated reason for using the lower level `python_build` https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26716#issuecomment-1356314359 was that it allowed specifying `CC=clang` which needs fewer resources, but `pyenv install` can do that as well.  \r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/pull/695",

          "body": "> Could you expand on the logic of this - is it just because the most effective DoS vectors known today happen to involve non-standard but valid transactions, or does this hold with more generality?\r\n> What if the current DoS vectors involving non-standard txs are fixed in the future, and the most-effective known DoS vectors then will involve consensus-invalid txs - wouldn't we want to go back to punishing peers then?\r\n\r\nA DoS attack needs two features: each instance needs to be relatively high cost, and you need to be able to cheaply create many instances. The \"high cost\" part comes from the consensus-valid and standard-compliant parts of the tx -- for example a valid multisig script that checks 20 signatures, or a script that calculates many hashes. The non-standard/consensus-invalid parts is what gives you the \"cheap repeatability\" part -- if the tx were standard and valid, you'd accept it into the mempool, and quickly reject other txs because they were double spends, or require them to bump the fee, eventually making the tx costly.\r\n\r\nMaking the tx non-standard gives you an easy way to repeat the attack: because we reject the tx, we'll have to re-evaluate a new tx that spends the same inputs with the same fee to see if it's possibly valid. If all the txs are consensus-invalid the attacker won't even risk paying fees to a miner, but even if they are, they can still send a million variations on a single tx to you, and only have to pay a single fee to a miner for whichever one is eventually confirmed.\r\n\r\nIf we were in a world where there weren't many standardness rules and consensus rules dominated mempool acceptance, then we probably wouldn't want to discourage/ban for some consensus failures in that case -- recent soft forks would make previously valid txs invalid for both block inclusion and mempool acceptance, so discouraging peers who sent us those sorts of transactions would increase the p2p network's fragility, possibly leading to network splits. If we did want to selectively discourage peers who should have upgraded, that would suggest reinstating the `RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE` logic linked to above. In that world, an attacker could DoS us with txs that violated recent consensus rules, without being banned/discouraged.\r\n\r\nThe main DoS protection here is to limit how much tx validation can interfere with other processing, so not evaluating potentially expensive scripts a second time when we already know they're not interesting is more of a step forwards.",

It would effectively be a tightening of standardness (runtime upgrade hook checks like the key version would be statically inspected instead), but not one that should cause any issue to non-pathological transactions. For non-Tapscript scripts, short of restricting standardness to Miniscript-compatible scripts, i am not sure it's realistic. For instance, i am not sure we could come up with a generalist way to inspect whether a redeem script / witness script is going to fail the MINIMALIF check without executing it.\r\n\r\nBut more importantly i am not sure it's worth it. As far as i can tell the existing behaviour does not exist for DoS resistance as it's trivial for an attacker to circumvent (although it seems to be the reason why it was originally introduced), but as an opportunistic way to boot off non-malicious misbehaving peers.\r\n\r\n> But most critically the primary reason to disconnect [...] is to prevent our finite connection slots from being consumed by peers which have adopted consensus rules which are incompatible\r\n\r\nAnd we do so very inconsistently. Any consensus-invalid transaction which has a non-standard header or a non-standard input before the consensus-invalid input will be treated as non-standard and the peer not disconnected. Plus as @ajtowns points out in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33012#issuecomment-3111631541 we would already disconnect those peers after two incompatible blocks.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me the current behaviour is the result of starting off with always disconnecting for script failure with #517 and progressively carving out exceptions (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33050#issuecomment-3113000946). As a result we don't consistently achieve the primary reason you state for this behaviour, but we still double our CPU DoS exposure.\r\n\r\nI think the tradeoff of getting rid of the opportunistic early-disconnection of misbehaving peers in order to halve our CPU DoS exposure is worth it.",

It is not the case that consensus-invalidity is inherently more harmful to us (in terms of DoS potential) than non-standardness violations, and attackers can today already mask any consensus-invalidity by causing a non-standardness to be detected first, evading the punishment.\r\n\r\nSo it seems the benefit of this distinction is largely so we can kick peers with diverging consensus rules. That is worthwhile, but we have other measures that take care of this already: disconnecting ones that give invalid blocks, and actively seeking out more connections when we don't learn about a new block for a while.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to improve upon this somewhat without double/triple execution in theory, if we could do a single execution that reported using something like #33012, but that's a much more invasive change. If we don't limit what code changes we're willing to make, I think an ideal situation is something where execution runs once, with all flags enabled, and then returns:\r\n* If a \"DoSy condition\" (whether consensus or standardness) is reached, immediately (with what type of failure).\r\n* Otherwise, run until consensus failure or consensus success, and then return success/success+nonstandard/consensus failure.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell \r\n\r\n> I don't see why all standardness rules can't be validated prior to doing any costly hashing or signature validation (sadly, they do require looking up inputs which is costly).\r\n\r\nIn Taproot I think that's possible for signature validation at least, because execution paths can be determined without executing sigchecks. For other scripts, or other expensive operations in tapscript (like big OP_ROLLs) it seems much harder.\r\n\r\nBut moreover, I think what we want here, for the goal of keeping our slots reserved for consensus-compatible clients, is determining whether a transaction is consensus-invalid *even* when it is non-standard. Absent that, it's independently useful to avoid doing expensive checks if can determine rejection without that, but I think that can be done separately, and also, this goal is somewhat in conflict with determining consensus invalidity.\r\n\r\nI think the question really is: how much computational work are we willing to do, for an already-known-non-standard transaction, to determine it's also consensus invalid do we can free the connection slot? If the answer is nothing, then this PR is the complete solution. If it's more than that, then more complicated solutions may be considered.",
