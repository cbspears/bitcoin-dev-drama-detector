      "title": "MacOS updated Bitcoin-Core gui icon in accordance with Apple design docs",
      "body": "**Mac OS Minor icon change**\r\nApple's design guidelines have changed since the previous iteration of the Bitcoin-Core app icon. As it stands, the current icon is too large, and juts out when viewed alongside other program's icons. \r\nMy solution was to decrease the overall size to more closely fit Apple's current design documentation, keeping the main body of the icon in the body section of MacOS's icon template, while maintaining the same shape, color, and design.\r\nMy motives for this method were caused by Spotify's app icon. Fundamentally, it is very similar to Bitcoin-Core (Circle, plain color, iconography inside circe) yet Spotify's icon is sightly smaller and in-bound. This allows their icon to live amongst the other squircles without seeming too out of place.\r\nAnother option i considered was making the icon into a squircle. This, i would personally prefer. I didn't opt for that for one reason, however: Familiarity.\r\nI consider my small change positive to everyone including people who dislike change and respect familiarity.\r\nThe .icns file was compiled using Apple's own \"iconutil\" cli program.\r\n\r\nI have successfully built this fork and i am using it without issue.",
