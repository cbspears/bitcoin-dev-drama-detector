I avoided it because it would bloat the diff as a lot of lines inside the body of the functions will be touched. Then there are also the other parameters `addrConnect` and `fCountFailure` that would warrant a rename. Further, `addrConnect` and `pszDest` both mean the same thing and should both be called `destination` :-X maybe combine them into one variable `std::variant<CAddress, const char*> destination`? Either way I would like to keep this PR minimal, only containing what is needed for https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415.",

It would eliminate some parameter passing that's only used for private broadcast connections. but might make `proxy` lifetime unclear (not sure about this), just curious if you considered this.\r\n\r\nIn general, saving the proxy somewhere and later retrieving it from `ConnectNode()` would make it difficult, from within `ConnectNode()` to figure out (or to reason about) where did the value came from. During debugging and during code analysis. Similar to what happens with global variables.\r\n\r\nAlso that would make `ConnectNode()` private broadcast aware - in there will be code that is specific to private broadcast and cannot be reused.

AJ Towns’ observation from [#32406](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406/commits/0b4048c73385166144d0b3e76beb9a2ac4cc1eca#r2084024874) that “_for now there seem to be a bunch of users who like the option_” has only become more apparent in the months since.\r\n\r\n**The deprecation intent is unclear to users**\r\nThis echo’s Ava Chow’s comment from #32714 that “_IMO we should not have removal warnings if there is no current plan to actually remove them._” In months since that comment, partially due to increased feedback from Bitcoin Core users wanting to keep this option, there is even less likelihood of a near term plan to remove these options. That leaves Bitcoin Core users in an unclear situation: the option could be removed in the next version or perhaps never. Removing the deprecation gives clarity for their planning purposes. Deprecating the option in the future, preferably with a removal schedule to better inform users, would still be possible.\r\n\r\n**Minimal downsides to removing deprecation**\r\nAs a best practice, Bitcoin Core has avoided an option when the developers cannot articulate when they should be used. There is non-zero maintenance cost to keeping this code around (although leaving the options deprecated for a long time has the same effect). “Don’t offer users footguns” is also a good principle, but with this option, there seems to be only small impacts that can quickly be remedied by changing the option value by Bitcoin Core users. There already exist in Bitcoin Core more potentially-user-harmful options/values than what datacarrier might cause.\r\n",

      "title": "Documentation trap when using -bind in conjunction with (automatically configured) Tor hidden services",
      "body": "To start with the conclusion: everything appears to work as _intended_, so this should probably not be considered a bug as such, but some logging and telemetry output could be improved to make things clearer.\n\nIf you use -bind to manually specify which (public) IPs to listen to, Bitcoin Core will also no longer create the (local) default socket for incoming Tor connections at 127.0.01:8334 unless you specify it manually in your list - this is probably working as intended. When automatically creating a Tor hidden service, it will instead be routed to the public IPv4 port, and incoming Tor connections still work just fine.\n\nHowever, without the dedicated Tor socket, Bitcoin Core is unable to distinguish between regular IPv4 connections and Tor connections, so all of the latter will be counted as the former.\n\nThe specific case that had me scratching my head for a bit: -netinfo reported zero incoming Tor connections\n\n```\n         ipv4    ipv6   onion   total   block\nin        291      28       0     319\nout         5       3       2      10       2\ntotal     296      31       2     329\n```\n\nwhile the true number of incoming Tor connections was 29.\n\n```\nss -tupan | grep tor | grep 8333 | wc -l\n29\n```\n\nAs expected, removing the -bind statements from the config and restarting fixed it.\n\n```\n         ipv4    ipv6   onion   total   block\nin         25       4       5      34\nout         4       1       5      10       2\ntotal      29       5      10      44\n```\n\nWhile the documentation for -bind hints towards why this is the case, Bitcoin Core gives no indication in the logs or the -netinfo output that the configuration is suboptimal, and I feel like maybe it should do that just to save people (like me) from getting confused.\n\nMaybe during startup, if no Tor socket is created and a Tor hidden service is created, it should add something like \"Warning: -bind was specified but lacks a dedicated Tor socket; incoming Tor connections will be counted as regular connections\", and when using -netinfo it should show a \"?\" or \"-\" instead of \"0\".",
