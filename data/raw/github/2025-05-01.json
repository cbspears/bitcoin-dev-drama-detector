      "body": "Running large commands via `bitcoin-cli` (such as submitting a large tx or block) runs into the `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` limit, which is 128KB on many systems. (see e.g. https://trofi.github.io/posts/299-maximum-argument-count-on-linux-and-in-gcc.html for more info).\r\n\r\nThis PR suggests to make it possible to bypass this limit by allowing to put the command and all of its args into a file. The functional test framework is then adjusted to automatically use this option (using a temporary file) if `--usecli` is specified and there is an arg that is too large.\r\nThis might also be helpful for users outside of the functional tests (although there is always the option to use the rpc interface directly instead of `bitcoin-cli`).\r\n\r\nThis is something many of our functional tests run into when executed with `--usecli` on master: (`OSError: [Errno 7] Argument list too long: 'bitcoin-cli'`)\r\nThe third commit enables several of them - there are a few more tests than those mentioned there, that could be enabled in a follow-up, but need some more adjustments beyond that.\r\n",

      "title": "fees: rpc: `estimatesmartfee` now returns a fee rate estimate during low network activity",
      "body": "This PR fixes #32105 and related issues: #32178, #31116, and #31032.  \r\nThe main motivation is outlined in [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32178#issuecomment-2830820374)).\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core users have reported several issues where nodes are unable to provide fee rate estimates, despite having run long enough to do so for a given target. This typically occurs when there is low activity on the network.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the issue primarily affects nodes running on test networks `signet` and `testnetn`.\r\n\r\nI think it is safe safe to return the maximum of `mempoolminfee` and `minrelaytxfee` but only **after** the node has run long enough to be able to provide an estimate for the target and still cannot.  \r\n(_This avoids the issue of returning an unreliable estimate too early_, as described by [glozow](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32178#issuecomment-2831440563)).\r\n\r\nThe only potential downside is in scenarios where the user has very very poor peer connectivity and most incoming mempool transactions are not seen by the node.  \r\nEven then, with the current full RBF  support,  txs can safely be fee bumped if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### This PR includes two commits:\r\n\r\n- **Bugfix for `MaxUsableEstimate`**: It should not return `1` as a usable target, since this is effectively not usable.\r\n- **Update to the `estimatesmartfee` RPC behavior**: Now returns the maximum of `minrelaytxfee` and `mempoolminfee` when the estimator has recorded enough blocks for the requested confirmation target, but cannot produce an estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Additional Context:\r\n\r\nThe fee estimator should be able of providing an estimate for a confirmation target `n` after observing at least `n * 2` blocks from either historical or current stats. The method `MaxUsableEstimate` determines this.\r\n\r\nIn the `estimateSmartFee` RPC method, the value shown as `blocks` in the result corresponds to the `returnedTarget`, which is the **minimum** of the user provided`conf_target` and the output of `MaxUsableEstimate`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, taking the maximum of `mempoolminfee` and `minrelaytxfee` when `returnedTarget >= conf_target` indicates that enough blocks have been recorded, but there is simply no activity on the network to provide estimate.  \r\nIn such cases, the mempool might be empty, and the transaction should pay enough to be relayed to peers making it likely to confirm since their is no demand.\r\n\r\n**Note**: The condition uses `>=` because, for example, a `conf_target` of 1 will result in a `returnedTarget` of 2 internally, so it is possible for `returnedTarget` to be > `conf_target`.\r\n",

Even based on recent mainnet network activity, it’s possible for us to see frequent empty blocks. In cases where the estimator have  seen enough blocks to be able to have the data but there is just no activity, paying the floating minfee is sufficient to get transactions to miners. I think this is the sane thing to do.\r\n\r\nIn test networks, this has been the reality for a while users want to transact, but the fee estimator says there’s insufficient data and indeed there isn't\r\n\r\n>  you may miss the fact that, f.e., miners are not mining anything 2x higher than your floating minfee.\r\n\r\nThis is unlikely in cases where there’s genuinely no activity on the network, as the floating minfee is sufficient to propagate transactions to miners. The scenario where miners aren't including transactions paying 2x the floating minfee typically occurs when there is enough activity on the network to price out low-feerate txs something the estimator, being only backward-looking, will eventually observe.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is one scenario where this might be perceived as an issue: when the node has run for (`n * 2 + n`) blocks, where the first `n * 2` blocks are mostly empty (i.e., no activity), and activity picks up only in the last `n` blocks. In such a case, data from just the last `n` blocks may not be sufficient to provide a reliable fee rate estimate for target `n`. As a result, we fall back to using the floating minfee as the estimate even though it may no longer reflect current network conditions. But that edge case may not be an issue, as it reflects the behavior of the `block_policy_estimator`, which is inherently backward-looking in order to predict future rates.\r\n\r\nThe disconnect between current conditions and recent historical data is a key limitation of the `block_policy_estimator`, and it's one that appears frequently on mainnet. This is where a forward-looking fee rate forecaster would be particularly valuable.\r\n\r\nAlso, with full RBF now available, users can safely fee-bump.\r\n\r\n> I think this circles back to what the end goal of this RPC is, A one stop shop for best guess of feerates needed?\r\n\r\nI think that's how most users interpret it, hence the issue.\r\n",
