It does not impose a limit.\r\n\r\nIPC clients can query this footprint (total, across all clients) using the `getMemoryLoad()` IPC method. Its client-side usage is demonstrated here:\r\n- https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-tp/pull/63\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the functional test in `interface_ipc.py` is expanded to demonstrate how template memory management works: templates are not released until the client drops references to them, or calls the template destroy method, or disconnects. The destroy method is called automatically by clients using [libmultiprocess](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess), as [sv2-tp](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-tp) does. In the Python tests it also happens when references are destroyed or go out of scope.\r\n\r\nThe PR starts with preparation refactor commits:\r\n\r\n1. Tweaks `interface_ipc.py` so `destroy()` calls happen in an order that's useful to later demonstrate memory management\r\n2. Change `std::unique_ptr<BlockTemplate> block_template` from a `static` defined in `rpc/mining.cpp` to `NodeContext`. This prevents a crash when we switch to a non-trivial destructor later (which uses `m_node`).\r\n\r\nThen the main commits:\r\n\r\n3. Add `template_tx_refs` to `NodeContext` to track how many templates contain any given transaction. This map is updated by the `BlockTemplate` constructor and destructor.\r\n4. Add `GetTemplateMemoryUsage()` which loops over this map and sums up the memory footprint for transactions outside the mempool\r\n5. Expose this information to IPC clients via `getMemoryLoad()` and add test coverage\r\n",

      "title": "Implementation of SwiftSync",
      "body": "Link to the original protocol writeup found [here](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/a61a37d14182ccd78760e477c78133cd). See the [Delving Bitcoin post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/swiftsync-speeding-up-ibd-with-pre-generated-hints-poc/1562) for initial works and discussion.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nWhile many coins are available in cache when spent, every cache miss requires a trip to the disk. Memory can be scarce for single board machines, so cache misses are expected to be far more frequent. A trip to disk is all-the-more severe on low end hardware, so any minimization of disk interactions can speed up initial block download for limited resource devices. One such example may be a block template provider serving a home miner.\r\n\r\n# Intuition\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of coins created are later spent. The cost of this observation is many coins will be written to disk, only to be removed later. The SwiftSync protocol alleviates the problem by recording what coins have been added and removed with a small, in-memory aggregate. This allows for the removal of intermediate coin states until SwiftSync has completed. The state of the aggregate is verified at a predetermined chain height, and IBD continues as usual thereafter.\r\n\r\nFor any chain height, we know `all outputs - all inputs = UTXO set`, which is equivalently `all outputs - UTXO set = all inputs`. The goal is to verify the set `all outputs - UTXO set` is equal to `all inputs`. Addition and subtraction modulo a field offers a way to do so. For any set, if we add all elements of the set and subtract them, regardless of ordering, we will arrive at zero. In the current implementation, the set elements being compared are hashed outpoints.\r\n\r\nThe SwiftSync protocol is comprised of two structures. First, the aggregate that will record the state of what outpoints have been added (created) or subtracted (spent). Next, notice that the UTXO set must be reported in order to verify `all outputs - UTXO set = all inputs`. SwiftSync introduces a hints file, which may be provided to the client at startup. This hints file is nothing more than a pointer to each unspent output by recording the block height and the indexes that will remain unspent. By using this file, a client may omit outpoints that will be in the UTXO set when updating the aggregate. Note this file is not trusted. If a malicious actor provides a faulty UTXO set, the set comparison above will fail, and the client may begin a reindex.\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\n## Aggregate\r\n\r\nThe hash aggregate takes outpoints, hashes them with a salted hasher, and updates 4, 64-bit limbs with wrapping modulo arithmetic. The choice of 4, 64-bit limbs with no carries between limbs was made to: 1. minimize code complexity within the aggregate 2. conform to existing APIs, namely `uint256`. After adding and subtracting some arbitrary list of outpoints, we may poll if the sets were equivalent with `IsZero`.\r\n## Hintsfile\r\n\r\nThe hints file is a map of block height to the indexes of the outputs in that block that _will_ be in the UTXO set. To construct this file for a particular UTXO set state, each block must be read and queried to find the outputs in that block that remain unspent. Because this is a read-only operation, this may be done on parallel threads in the future. To allow for parallelization, the hints file contains a \"contents\" section, which denotes the height and corresponding file position to find the hints for that block.\r\n\r\nTo save space when representing the indexes that remain unspent in a block, an easy choice is to take the difference between the last coin that was unspent and the next one in the block. AFICT this is a version of run-length-encoding. These indexes are encoded using `compactSize` to further save space, the run-lengths should normally fit into at least 16 bits, often 8 bits.\r\n## Parameter Interaction\r\n\r\nA side effect of omitting intermediate UTXO states while performing IBD is the \"undo data\" cannot be derived. There are already configurations that do not have full undo data history, namely pruned nodes. To avoid additional complexity in this PR, this version of accelerated IBD is only made available to pruned nodes, as the undo data would have been removed regardless of the this setting.\r\n\r\nOther parameter interactions, not yet implemented:\r\n- `assumeutxo`: Startup should fail if both are configured. A hints file will have no effect, as the UTXO set is already present.\r\n- `assumevalid`: A natural choice is to only allow SwiftSync when using `assumevalid`, and to only allow a hints file that commits to the `assumevalid` block. Similar to `assumeutxo`, a hash of the hints file may be committed to in the binary, which would be resistant to griefing attacks.\r\n# Testing [Linux example]\r\n\r\nIn your `bitcoin` directory, download the hints from the test server:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -o signet.hints https://utxohints.store/hints/signet\r\n```\r\n\r\nVerify the hash of the file:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\necho \"2b625392ecb2adba2b5f9d7b00c8f3a8adca0d3c  signet.hints\" | sha1sum --check -\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild the branch:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncmake -B build && cmake --build build -j $(nproc)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemove existing chain state:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrm -rf ~/.bitcoin/signet/\r\n```\r\n\r\nProvide the file at startup:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./build/bin/bitcoind --chain=signet --utxohints=./signet.hints --prune=550\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Open Questions\r\n\r\n- Given the outcome of SwiftSync is pass/fail, and there is no use of intermediate states, should blocks be persisted to disk at all during the protocol?\r\n- To what degree should a hints file be committed to in the binary. No commitment allows for a server to provide hints for an arbitrary height, providing a convenience for the client, but opens up the possibility of a grief attack. Of course the server risks losing reputation for serving faulty files.\r\n\r\n# Future Iteration\r\n\r\nThis is the first iteration of the SwiftSync proposal, however more optimizations may be made. Namely, because set elements may be added or subtracted from the aggregate in any order, blocks may be downloaded in parallel from multiple peers. If you are interested in benchmarking the performance of a fully-parallel version, see the [Rust implementation](https://github.com/2140-dev/swiftsync).\r\n",

      "title": "fees: Introduce Mempool Based Fee Estimation to reduce overestimation",
      "body": "This PR is another attempt to fix #27995 using a better approach.\r\n\r\nFor background and motivation, see #27995 and the discussion in the Delving Bitcoin post [Mempool Based Fee Estimation on Bitcoin Core](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703)\r\nThis PR is currently limited to using the mempool only to lower what is recommended by the Block Policy Estimator.\r\nAccurate and safe fee estimation using the mempool is challenging. There are open questions about how to prevent mempool games that are theoretically possible for miners [(a variant of the Finney attack)](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/6)\r\n\r\nThis is one of the reasons I opted to use the mempool only to lower the Block Policy Estimator, which itself is not gameable, and therefore this mechanism is not susceptible to this attack.\r\n\r\nThe underlying assumption here is that, with the current tools and work done to make RBF and CPFP feasible and guarantee (TRUC transaction relay, ephemeral anchors, cluster size 2 package rbf), it is safer to underestimate rather than overestimate.\r\nWe now assume it is relatively easy to fee-bump later if a transaction does not confirm, whereas once a fee is overestimated there is no way to recover from that.\r\n\r\nAnother open question when using the mempool for fee estimation is how to account for incoming transaction inflow.\r\n[Bitcoin Augur](https://github.com/block/bitcoin-augur) does this by using past inflow plus a constant expected inflow to predict future inflow. I find this unconvincing for fee estimation and potentially prone to more overestimation, as past conditions are not always representative of the future. See my [review of the Augur fee rate estimator and open questions](https://github.com/block/bitcoin-augur/issues/3).\r\n\r\nThis PR uses a much simpler approach based on current user behavior, similar to the widely used method employed by mempool.space: looking at the top block of the mempool and selecting a percentile feerate depending on whether the user is economical or conservative.\r\n\r\nEmpirical data from both myself and Clara Shikhelman shows that the 75th percentile feerate for economical users and the 50th percentile feerate for conservative users provide positive confirmation guarantees, hence this is what is used in this PR.\r\n\r\nParallel research by René Pickhardt and his student suggests that using the [average fee per byte of the block template performs well](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/12).\r\n\r\nAll of these are constants that can be adjusted, there is parallel work exploring these constants and running benchmarks across fee estimators to find a sweet spot.\r\n\r\nSee also work in LND, the [LND Budget Sweeper](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/lnds-deadline-aware-budget-sweeper/1512), which applies this idea successfully. Their approach is to estimate fees initially with bitcoind, then increment gradually as the confirmation deadline approaches, using a fixed fee budget.\r\n\r\nHistorical data indicates that by doing only the approach in this PR, we are able to [reduce overestimation quite significantly (~29%)](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/8).\r\n\r\nThis is particularly useful in scenarios where the Block Policy Estimator recommends a high feerate while the mempool is empty.\r\n<img width=\"1800\" height=\"1090\" alt=\"56f3ba26c0184521c42bb82ec9d8c9f2224d4f8e\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c035c40c-8ece-42a7-b290-d29f1ac9bf4d\" />\r\n\r\nAs seen in the image above, there is only one remaining unfixed case: when there is a sudden inflow of transactions and the feerate rises, the Block Policy Estimator takes time to reflect this. In that case, users will continue to see a low feerate estimate until it slowly updates. From the historical data linked above, [this occurs about ~26% of the time](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/8)).\r\n\r\nOverall, we observe a **73% success rate with 0% overestimation, and 26% underestimation** with this approach.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes refactors that enable this work. Rather than splitting the PR and implementing changes incrementally, I opted for an end-to-end implementation:\r\n\r\n### 1. Refactors\r\n\r\n* Separation of feerate format from the fee estimate mode enumerator (separation of concerns, as they are semantically distinct)\r\n* Move logging after fee estimation estimateSmartFee from the wallet to the Block Policy Estimator internal method (also separation of concerns and avoiding leaking fee estimator internals). This change also comes with updating `createTransactionInternal` to log only the fee and its source (fee estimator, fallback fee, etc.), which is more appropriate.\r\n* Separate the fee estimate mode enum from the fee source enumerator (separation of concerns, as they are semantically distinct). This introduces a minor breaking change: the wallet RPCs now return fee *source* instead of fee *reason*, which is more accurate. Let me know if we prefer to keep the field name unchanged while returning the fee source.\r\n* Move the `StringForReason` enum from `common` to the Block Policy Estimator (also separation of concerns)\r\n* Various test file updates and renames for improved accuracy\r\n* Update Block Policy Estimator unit tests to be independent of the mempool and the validation interface\r\n\r\n### 2. Introduce Mempool-Based Fee Estimator and Fee Estimator Manager\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new abstract fee estimator base class that all fee estimators must implement\r\n\r\n* Introduce `FeeRateEstimateResult` as the response type, containing metadata and avoiding the use of out-parameters. This is easily extensible and makes future changes less invasive, as method signatures do not need to change.\r\n\r\n* Add `FeeEstimatorType` enum to identify different fee estimators\r\n\r\n* Make `CBlockPolicyEstimator` derive from the new fee estimator base class\r\n\r\n* Add `FeeRateEstimatorManager`, responsible for managing all fee estimators\r\n\r\n* Update the node context to store a `unique_ptr` to `FeeRateEstimatorManager` instead of `CBlockPolicyEstimator`\r\n\r\n* Update `CBlockPolicyEstimator` to no longer subscribe directly to the validation interface; instead, `FeeRateEstimatorManager` subscribes and forwards relevant notifications\r\n\r\n* Add a percentile calculation function that takes the chunk feerates of a block template and returns feerate percentiles; this can also be reused by the `getblockstats` RPC\r\n\r\n* Add a mempool fee estimator that generates a block template when called, calculates a percentile feerate, and returns the 75th percentile for economical mode or the 50th percentile for conservative mode\r\n\r\n* Add caching to the mempool estimator so that new estimates are generated only every 7 seconds, assuming enough [transactions have propagated](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/125776/how-long-does-it-take-for-a-transaction-to-propagate-through-the-network/125777#125777) to make a meaningful difference.\r\n  This heuristic will likely be replaced by requesting block templates via the general-purpose block template cache proposed here: [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33389](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33389)\r\n\r\n* Update `MempoolTransactionRemovedForBlock` to return the actual block transactions as well\r\n\r\n* Track the weight of block transactions and evicted transactions after each block connection\r\n  This data is tracked for the last 6 mined blocks. A mempool feerate estimate is returned only when the average ratio of mempool transaction weight evicted due to `BLOCK` reasons to block transaction weight is greater than 75%. This heuristic provides rough confidence that the node’s mempool matches that of the majority of the hashrate. The 75% threshold is arbitrary and can be adjusted.\r\n\r\nThere is a caveat when transactions in the local mempool are consistently not mined by the network, as described in #27995 (e.g., due to filtering).\r\nAccounting for these transactions during fee estimation is not necessary, as they should be evicted from the mempool itself (see #33510). Handling this again within fee estimation would be redundant.\r\n\r\n* Persist statistics for the 6 most recent blocks to disk during periodic flushes and shutdown, so this data is available after restarts\r\n* Expose this data to users when running `estimatesmartfee` with verbosity > 2\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>see example output</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli estimatesmartfee 1 \"conservative\" 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"feerate\": 0.00002133,\r\n  \"errors\": [],\r\n  \"blocks\": 2,\r\n  \"mempool_health_statistics\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"block_height\": 927953,\r\n      \"block_weight\": 3991729,\r\n      \"mempool_txs_weight\": 3942409,\r\n      \"ratio\": 0.987644451815241\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>",

      "body": "picks up https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25269.\r\n\r\nThis PR re-implements the code path so that an error message is thrown when a transaction's total amount (including fees) exceeds the available balance. It also refactors the wallet's coin selection code.\r\n\r\n1. the first 3 commits are unrelated to the code but few small bug fixes which are nice to fix. but also kind of impacts the remaining logic. (could PR separately if reviewers wish)\r\n\t1. c467325aaf187d7f056bb1ea1cec6b7c4250af2e: make `total_effective_amount` optional actually optional\r\n\t2. 2202ab597596c84fc49f8784e823372b7a9efcbe: ensure `set<shared_ptr<COutput>>` has unique COutput\r\n\t3. a5ffbbf122d66fc4ad9b2e7c6d7d1dfa1816388e: Correctly reserve size when flattening `CoinsResult.coins` map to vector\r\n\r\n3. the next 3 commits from 4745d5480ca5c3809edd51140e4d2c0433582844 replace the `PreSelectedInputs` struct with `CoinsResult` and removes `PreSelectedInputs`.\r\n\r\n4. the last commit (e664484a6d34c1795ebb0925ab31faea5d64ab00) deals with the error message - `AmountWithFeeExceedsBalance` error inside `WalletModel::prepareTransaction` is never thrown and remains an unused code path. This is because `createTransaction` does not retrieve the fee when the process fails. The fee return arg is set only at the end of the process, when the transaction is successfully created. Therefore, if the transaction creation fails, the fee is not available inside `WalletModel::prepareTransaction` to trigger the `AmountWithFeeExceedsBalance` error.\r\n\r\nThis PR re-implements the feature inside `CreateTransactionInternal` and adds test coverage for it.\r\n\r\n| on master | on PR |\r\n|-----------|-------|\r\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a903e687-2466-42c7-b898-5dec24bfe515\" width=\"750\" alt=\"Insufficient funds\" /> | <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74bb3c83-6132-4c09-91f0-0a446618b3c8\" width=\"750\" alt=\"AmountWithFeeExceedsBalance\" /> |\r\n\r\nthe unreachable code path is removed in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/807 which requires this PR.\r\n",

      "title": "Cluster mempool: more accurate cost model for SFL",
      "body": "Builds on top of #34023, part of #30289.\r\n\r\nThis introduces a more accurate cost model for SFL, to control how much CPU time is spent inside the algorithm for clusters that cannot be linearized perfectly within a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\nThe goal is having a metric for the amount of work performed, so that txmempool can impose limits on that work: a lower bound that is always performed (unless optimality is reached before that point, of course), and an upper bound to limit the latency and total CPU time spent on this. There are conflicting design goals here:\r\n* On the one hand, it seems ideal if this metric is closely correlated to actual CPU time, because otherwise the limits become inaccurate.\r\n* On the other hand, it seems a nightmare to have the metric be platform/system dependent, as it makes network-wide reasoning nearly impossible. It's expected that slower systems take longer to do the same thing; this holds for everything, and we don't need to compensate for this.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple solutions to this:\r\n* One extreme is just measuring the time. This is very accurate, but extremely platform dependent, and also non-deterministic due to random scheduling/cache effects.\r\n* The other extreme is using a very abstract metric like counting how many times certain loops/function inside the algorithm run. That is what is implemented as of #32545 and #34023, just counting the sum of the numbers of transactions updated across all `UpdateChunks()` calls. It however necessarily fails to account for significant portions of runtime spent elsewhere, resulting in a rather wide range of \"ns per cost\" values.\r\n* This PR takes a middle ground, counting many function calls / branches / loops, with weights that were determined through benchmarking on an average on a number of systems.\r\n",

I don't think we have an existing Linux CI job that doesn't have a gcc/stdlibc++ install. This exercises the depends logic for a fully LLVM/Clang/lld only build, including building the native tools (related to #33902).\r\n* We don't currently have a job with LTO enabled (here using CMakes `CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION`, which is `-flto=thin` for LLVM/Clang). I think this is worth having generally (we do use LTO in some other places, like oss-fuzz). If runtime is too much of an issue, then it could also be dropped.

      "body": "This is a slightly modified version of the first few commits of #31132, which can be merged as an independent change. It has a small benefit on its own, but will help in moving the parent PR forward.\r\n\r\nWhen accessing coins via the `CCoinsViewCache`, methods like `GetCoin` can call `FetchCoin` which actually mutate `cacheCoins` internally to cache entries when they are pulled from the backing db. This is generally a performance improvement for single threaded access patterns, but it precludes us from accessing entries in a `CCoinsViewCache` from multiple threads without a lock.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect is that when we use the resettable `CCoinsViewCache` view backed by the main cache for use in `ConnectBlock()`, we will insert entries into the main cache even if the block is determined to be invalid. This is not the biggest concern, since an invalid block requires proof-of-work. But, an attacker could craft multiple invalid blocks to fill the main cache. This would make us `Flush` the cache more often than necessary. Obviously this would be very expensive to do on mainnet.\r\n\r\nIntroduce `CoinsViewOverlay`, a `CCoinsViewCache` subclass that reads coins without mutating the underlying cache via `FetchCoin()`.\r\n\r\nAdd `PeekCoin()` to look up a Coin through a stack of `CCoinsViewCache` layers without populating parent caches. This prevents the main cache from caching inputs pulled from disk for a block that has not yet been fully validated. Once `Flush()` is called on the view, these inputs will be added as spent to `coinsCache` in the main cache via `BatchWrite()`.\r\n\r\nThis is the foundation for async input fetching, where worker threads must not mutate shared state.\r\n",

      "title": "mining: add cooldown to createNewBlock() immediately after IBD",
      "body": "_This PR makes a breaking change to the Mining interface._\r\n\r\nAs reported in #33994, connected mining clients will receive a flood of new templates if the node is still going through IBD or catching up on the last 24 hours. This PR fixes that using an _optional_ cooldown mechanism, only applied to `createNewBlock()`.\r\n\r\nFirst, cooldown waits for IBD. Then, as the tip keeps moving forward, it waits a few seconds to see if the tip updated. If so, it restarts the timer and waits again. The trade-offs for this mechanism are explained below.\r\n\r\nBecause this PR changes `createNewBlock()` from a method that returns quickly to one that can block for minutes, the first commit fixes a bug in our `.capnp` definition, adding the missing `context` to `createNewBlock` (and `checkBlock`). It's an improved version of #33936.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking API change, so it bumps the `makeMining` version and throws a nice error for older clients. That's tested in the functional test, and I also saw it with the sv2 Rust client. It may be possible to instead work around the existing bug and avoid the breaking change, but I don't think that's worth the efort and potential confusion at this point.\r\n\r\nThe second commit introduces the actual cooldown mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe third then adds an `interrupt()` method so that clients can cleanly disconnect.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThe cooldown argument is optional, and not used by internal non-IPC code, for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The mechanism wreaks havoc on the functional test suite, which would require very careful mock time handling to work around. But that's pointless, because only IPC clients need it.\r\n2. It needs to be optional for IPC clients too, because in some situations, like a signet with only one miner, waiting for IBD can mean being stuck forever.\r\n\r\nThe reason it's only applied to `createNewBlock()` is that this is the first method called by clients; `waitNext()` is a method on the interface returned by `createNewBlock()`, at which point the cooldown is done.\r\n\r\nAfter IBD, we wait N seconds if the header is N blocks ahead of the tip, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 20 seconds. The minimum waiting time is short enough that it shouldn't be annoying or confusing for someone manually starting up a client. While the maximum should be harmless if it happens spuriously (which it shouldn't).\r\n\r\nIf the minimum wait is too short, clients get a burst of templates, as observed in the original issue. We can't entirely rule this out without a lot of additional complexity (like scanning our own log file for heuristics). This PR should make it a lot less likely, and thanks to the IBD wait also limit it to one day worth of blocks (`-maxtipage`).\r\n\r\nSome test runs on an M4 MacBook Pro, where I had a node catch up on the last few days worth of blocks:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"872\" height=\"972\" alt=\"Scherm­afbeelding 2026-02-04 om 18 21 17\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7902a0f2-0e0b-4604-9688-cec2da073261\" />\r\n\r\nAs the chart shows, sometimes it takes longer than 3 seconds. But it turns out that in all those cases there were quite a few headers ahead of the tip. It also demonstrates that it's important to first wait for IBD, because it's less likely a random tip update takes longer than 20 seconds.\r\n\r\n- modified sv2-apps: https://github.com/Sjors/sv2-apps/tree/2026/02/cooldown\r\n- test script: https://gist.github.com/Sjors/feb6122c97acc2b9e6d66b168614609c#file-run_mainnet_pool_loop-zsh\r\n- chart script: https://gist.github.com/Sjors/feb6122c97acc2b9e6d66b168614609c#file-tip_interval_charts-py",

Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review.

The `Next()` method also calls into this with a `nullptr` if invoked with `nullptr`. While most call sites have indirect guarantee that the input is not `nullptr`, it's not easy to establish this to all call sites with high confidence. These methods are publicly available. There is no known high-level use case to trigger this error, but the fix is easy, and makes the code safer.\r\n\r\nAlso, unit tests were added to the `CChain` class, filling a gap.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n- Add basic unit tests for `CChain` class methods\r\n- Add a nullptr-check to `CChain::Contains()`\r\n\r\nAlternative.

      "body": "# Background\r\nNextSyncBlock() is used in BaseIndex::Sync() to get the next block index to be synced, so that BaseIndex::Sync() can build the index for that block.\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1d3243806da6db8bd13e6b20906628ed434362b6/src/index/base.cpp#L150-L151\r\n\r\nIt normally calls chain.Next(pindex_prev) to get the next block index on the active chain. If that fails, pindex_prev is on a fork. In that case, chain.FindFork(pindex_prev) is called to return the fork point, and then chain.Next(fork point) is returned for the caller to handle.\r\nThe latter logic is referred to as the fork code below.\r\n\r\n# Issue:\r\nThe current master implementation of NextSyncBlock() handles a specific case implicitly in the fork code.\r\n\r\nThe special case is pindex_prev == chain tip (simplified as the special case below). This means the input block is already the tip of the active chain, and there is no next block to be indexed anymore. Thus, NextSyncBlock() should return nullptr. This expectation is also implied in BaseIndex::Sync():\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1d3243806da6db8bd13e6b20906628ed434362b6/src/index/base.cpp#L220-L221\r\n\r\nAlthough NextSyncBlock() does return nullptr in this case, it is handled in a confusing code flow:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1d3243806da6db8bd13e6b20906628ed434362b6/src/index/base.cpp#L150-L166\r\n\r\ncalls line 158: chain.Next(pindex_prev) returns nullptr because the below code flow:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1d3243806da6db8bd13e6b20906628ed434362b6/src/chain.h#L417-L423\r\n\r\ncalls line 419: chain.Contains():\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1d3243806da6db8bd13e6b20906628ed434362b6/src/chain.h#L411-L414\r\n\r\ncalls line 405:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1d3243806da6db8bd13e6b20906628ed434362b6/src/chain.h#L403-L408\r\n\r\nThus in `NextSyncBlock` line 159, because pindex is nullptr, it finally falls into the fork code.\r\nit is handled only coincidentally by the fork code:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1d3243806da6db8bd13e6b20906628ed434362b6/src/index/base.cpp#L163-L165\r\n\r\nin this code, FindFork() is called,\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1d3243806da6db8bd13e6b20906628ed434362b6/src/chain.cpp#L50-L59\r\nand because pindex is the active chain tip, the `while` loop on line 56 is not iterated. It finally returns pindex itself.\r\nSo at last `chain.Next(pindex_prev)` is called again to return nullptr.\r\n\r\nHowever, the fork code is designed to handle reorgs, not this special case. This seems to be an oversight rather than something by design.\r\n\r\n# How to test it\r\n\r\nBecause `NextSyncBlock()` returns nullptr in the special case anyway, some debug code like `assert()` or `std::cout` or log sematics has to be added into this method to see the code flow in this method. The caller can be this unit test:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1d3243806da6db8bd13e6b20906628ed434362b6/src/test/txindex_tests.cpp#L16-L33\r\n\r\nLine 32 calls `Sync()` and it calls `NextSyncBlock()` \r\n\r\n# Solution:\r\nRather than modifying the comments on lines 163–164 to make them consistent with the fork code behavior, it would be better to handle this special case explicitly and early in NextSyncBlock().\r\n",

While most call sites have indirect guarantee that the input is not `nullptr`, it's not easy to establish this to all call sites with high confidence. These methods are publicly available. There is no known high-level use case to trigger this error, but the fix is easy, and makes the code safer.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n- Add basic unit tests for `CChain` class methods\r\n- Refactor `CChain::Contains()` to take reference\r\n- Refactor `CChain::Next()` to take reference\r\n- Add unit tests for `CChain::FindFork()`\r\n- Change `PeerManagerImpl::BlockRequestAllowed()` to take reference\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- ? /Change `CChain` internals to store references instead of pointers/\r\n- ? /Explore the change to always have at least one element (genesis), that way there is always genesis and tip./\r\n- Check related methods to change to reference -- `FindFork`, `FindEarliestAtLeast`, `FindForkInGlobalIndex`, `blockman.AddToBlockIndex`, etc.\r\n\r\nAlternative. A simpler change is to stick with pointers, with extra checks where needed, see #34416 .\r\n\r\nThis change is remotely related to and indirectly triggered by #32875 .\r\n",

      "title": "net: don't perform network activity when networkactive=0",
      "body": "## Problem\r\nWhen starting bitcoind with `-networkactive=0`, the node still performs various network activities despite the user explicitly requesting that the P2P network be inactive. This results in unnecessary log messages and network overhead:\r\n\r\n- `[addrman] Selected IP:PORT from tried` - Address manager selections\r\n- `[net:error] Could not get best interface for default route` - Gateway detection attempts\r\n- `[tor] Error connecting to Tor control socket` - Tor control connection attempts\r\n- `[tor] Not connected to Tor control port` - Tor reconnection attempts\r\n- `[net] portmap: Could not determine IPv4/IPv6 default gateway` - UPnP/NAT-PMP attempts\r\n\r\nThis defeats the purpose of the `-networkactive` flag, which is documented as \"Enable all P2P network activity (default: 1)\".\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Start bitcoind with `bitcoind.exe -networkactive=0`\r\n2. Observe logs - despite the flag being set to disable network activity, addrman selections and network-related errors are logged\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nNo network activity should occur when `-networkactive=0` is set at startup. The node should remain idle until network is activated via RPC command `setnetworkactive true`.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nThis PR ensures that when `networkactive=0`, no network initialization or activity occurs by:\r\n\r\n### 1. **ThreadOpenConnections (src/net.cpp)**\r\nAdded a check at the beginning of the main while loop to pause all outbound connection logic when `fNetworkActive` is false. This prevents:\r\n- Address selection from addrman\r\n- Connection attempts to peers\r\n- Feeler connections\r\n- Block relay connection attempts\r\n\r\nThis check follows the existing pattern used for DNS seed querying (lines 2345-2349) and uses the same synchronization mechanism (`fNetworkActive` atomic flag and `sleep_for` with interruption support).\r\n\r\n### 2. **StartMapPort (src/init.cpp)**\r\nMade NAT-PMP port mapping startup conditional on `-networkactive` being true. This prevents:\r\n- Port mapping initialization\r\n- Gateway detection attempts\r\n- Related network errors and log spam\r\n\r\n### 3. **StartTorControl (src/init.cpp)**\r\nMade Tor control thread startup conditional on `-networkactive` being true. This prevents:\r\n- Tor control socket connection attempts\r\n- Tor-related error logs\r\n- Unnecessary event loop setup\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThe fix has been verified to:\r\n- Compile without errors or warnings\r\n- Follow existing code patterns and conventions used in the same functions\r\n- Use the same argument parsing method as existing code (`args.GetBoolArg(\"-networkactive\", true)`)\r\n- Respect the interruption mechanism used throughout the codebase\r\n\r\n### Manual Testing\r\n```bash\r\n# Start with networkactive=0 - should see no network activity logs\r\nbitcoind -networkactive=0\r\n\r\n# Start with networkactive=1 (default) - normal behavior\r\nbitcoind\r\n```\r\n\r\nAffected Code Paths\r\n`src/net.cpp: CConnman::ThreadOpenConnections()` - Main connection management loop\r\n`src/init.cpp` Bitcoin Core initialization - MapPort and TorControl startup\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nThis change is backward compatible - default behavior (networkactive=1) is unchanged\r\nDynamic network activation via setnetworkactive true RPC will resume ThreadOpenConnections activity\r\nMapPort and TorControl remain stopped if started with networkactive=0 (can be addressed in follow-up if needed for dynamic activation)\r\n\r\nFixes #34190",

      "body": "This drops our dependency on `boost::signals2`, leaving `boost::multi_index` as the only remaining boost dependency for bitcoind.\r\n\r\n`boost::signals2` is a complex beast, but we only use a small portion of it. Namely: it's a way for multiple subscribers to connect to the same event, and the ability to later disconnect individual subscribers from that event.\r\n\r\n`btcsignals` adheres to the subset of the `boost::signals2` API that we currently use, and thus is a drop-in replacement. Rather than implementing a complex `slot` tracking class that we never used anyway (and which was much more useful in the days before std::function existed), callbacks are simply wrapped directly in `std::function`s.\r\n\r\nThe new tests work with either `boost::signals2` or the new `btcsignals` implementation. Reviewers can verify\r\nfunctional equivalency by running the tests in the commit that introduces them against `boost::signals2`, then again with `btcsignals`.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the commits in this PR are preparation and cleanup. Once `boost::signals2` is no longer needed, it is removed from depends. Additionally, a few CMake targets no longer need boost includes as they were previously only required for signals.\r\n\r\nI think this is actually pretty straightforward to review. I kept things simple, including keeping types unmovable/uncopyable where possible rather than trying to define those semantics. In doing so, the new implementation has even fewer type requirements than boost, which I believe is due to a boost bug. I've opened a PR upstream for that to attempt to maintain parity between the implementations.\r\n\r\nSee individual commits for more details.\r\n\r\nCloses #26442.",

      "body": "    TL;DR\r\n    This patchset proposes a new design of scriptcheck worker pool with\r\n    atomic variables to leverage more cpu resource on a machine which the\r\n    current mutex version cannot. Achieve about 45% boost in performance.\r\n    \r\n    Main Idea:\r\n    \r\n    The current version of worker pool use mutex to do the synchronization\r\n    between worker threads, which makes the performance downgrade after\r\n    worker_threads_num >= 14. One root cause is the high contention on the\r\n    queue's mutex among worker threads. Workers repeatedly sleep and be woken\r\n    up in short time, leading to heavy context switching.\r\n    The idea is to use atomic variables to protect the queue, workers\r\n    acquire it and increase it with a batch_size(a small number). This\r\n    significantly reduces context switching.\r\n    \r\n    Implementation\r\n    \r\n    To implement it, below changes are made:(enabled in atomic mode)\r\n    - atomic<int> nNext is used to indicate the next available indice in the\r\n      queue\r\n    - atomic<int> nTodo2 is used to indicate the number of tasks left\r\n    - nBatchSize is the batch size of tasks everytime a worker consumes\r\n      it should be small to keep workload balance among workers\r\n    - m_mutex is still used, to protect m_result and conditional vars\r\n    - fAtomic to indicate which mode is enabled\r\n    - about the queue:\r\n    \r\n      - the queue is used as queue, not stacks any more\r\n      - the queue is 'add only', which means only adding tasks to it, don't\r\n        remove used tasks.\r\n    \r\n        the above two are a must to make this idea achievable, and the\r\n        second sacrifices space\r\n    \r\n      - start the workers only after all the tasks have been added to the\r\n        queue\r\n    \r\n        this is a trade-off to make the implementaion simple, a worker can\r\n        compare nNext + nBatchSize to queue.size() to find if there are\r\n        tasks undone in the queue, otherwise another atomic<int> tail is\r\n        needed, and race condition may exist in this way (need more\r\n        investigation). From my test, it's not 100% to say this is a\r\n        'trade-off' since it also brings something good, pros && cons:\r\n        - pros:\r\n            1. no contention among producer and consumers when adding tasks\r\n               to the queue\r\n            2. the adding period is very short compared to the verification\r\n               period\r\n        - cons:\r\n            1. the workers start later\r\n    \r\n    For details, please refer to the worker handler code\r\n    \r\n    Tests:\r\n    \r\n    - Numbers\r\n      - For blocks/s numbers\r\n        `./build/bin/bench_bitcoin --filter=ConnectBlockMixedEcdsaSchnor`\r\n      - For cpu usage numbers\r\n        `NANOBENCH_ENDLESS=ConnectBlockAllEcdsa ./build/bin/bench_bitcoin --filter=ConnectBlockAllEcdsa`\r\n    \r\n      - Some data is missing because the machine was billed by time, and there wasn't\r\n        enough time to complete all measurements.\r\n      - Some cells contain a range instead of a single value due to high fluctuations\r\n      - The numbers represent the average of multiple test runs.\r\n    \r\n               |     mutex verion       |   atomic version\r\n    nr_workers | blocks/s  | cpu usage  | blocks/s  | cpu usage2\r\n    -----------|-----------|------------|-----------|-------------\r\n    0          | 4.22      | 100%       | 4.2       | 100%\r\n    1          | 8.23      | 198%       | 8         | 191.3%\r\n    2          | 12.08     | 293.7%     | 11.6      | 276%\r\n    3          | 16        | 386.7%     | 14.9      | 354.5%\r\n    4          | 19.8      | 476.3%     |           |\r\n    5          | 23.12     | 565.4%     |           |\r\n    6          | 27.3      | 654%       | 23        | 560%\r\n    7          | 28.5      | 738%       |           |\r\n    8          | 33.8      | 809%       |           |\r\n    9          | 33.5      | 868%       | 28.5      | 730%\r\n    10         | 37.4      | 910%       | 30.5      | 777%\r\n    11         | 33~40     | 880%~928%  | 32        | 825%\r\n    12         | 22~39     | 860%~925%  | 32.5      | 830%\r\n    13         | 27.8~37   | 700%~913%  | 34.8      | 928%\r\n    15         | 24.8~38.9 | 640%~719%  | 38        | 1000%\r\n    19         | 18~23     | 370%~510%  | 41        | 1161%\r\n    22         | 7~18      | 270%~400%  |           |\r\n    25         | 6.4       | 260%       | 46        | 1400%\r\n    30         | 5         | 270%       | 49        | 1560%\r\n    60         | 5         | 280%       | 50~58     | 2100%\r\n    \r\n    - Env:\r\n     A virtual machine on cloud\r\n       Architecture:          x86_64\r\n       CPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit\r\n       Address sizes:         46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual\r\n       Byte Order:            Little Endian\r\n       CPU(s):                64\r\n       On-line CPU(s) list:   0-63\r\n       Vendor ID:             GenuineIntel\r\n       Model name:            Intel Xeon Processor (Cascadelake)\r\n       CPU family:            6\r\n       Model:                 85\r\n       Thread(s) per core:    2\r\n       Core(s) per socket:    16\r\n       Socket(s):             2\r\n       Stepping:              6\r\n       BogoMIPS:              5985.93\r\n     Virtualization features:\r\n       Hypervisor vendor:     KVM\r\n       Virtualization type:   full\r\n     Caches (sum of all):\r\n       L1d:                   2 MiB (64 instances)\r\n       L1i:                   2 MiB (64 instances)\r\n       L2:                    128 MiB (32 instances)\r\n       L3:                    32 MiB (2 instances)\r\n     NUMA:\r\n       NUMA node(s):          2\r\n       NUMA node0 CPU(s):     0-31\r\n       NUMA node1 CPU(s):     32-63\r\n    \r\n    Signed-off-by: Hao Xu <hao.xu@linux.dev>\r\n",

Seeing too many of these assertions in the `CWallet` class while\r\nreading the code is cognitively loaded, and after a while becomes\r\nannoying for the reader.\r\n\r\nNote: Such assertions in the migration specific functions have been\r\nleft untouched because they seem necessary there.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.

See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\n\nThe change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\n\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\n\nSlides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\n\n---\n\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).",

For example, there could be a `bitcoin-wallet sync` command that will update balances and sync latest transactions to an unloaded wallet, or a `bitcoin-wallet serve` subcommand that loads a wallet and serves RPC requests, or a `bitcoin-wallet shell` subcommand that allows running RPC methods interactively like the GUI console, or just general support for `bitcoin-wallet <rpc method> <rpc params>` invocations suggested https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13926#issuecomment-455187379.\n\nThis PR is small and doesn't do much. The only visible change is that `bitcoin-wallet` now checks whether a node socket exists on startup and prints \"Connected to IPC address\" if it can connect it it.\n\nThe default `bitcoin-wallet` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which connects if possible as described above, and proceeds offline if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to disable ipc, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\n\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)\n\n---\n\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).",

This allows the GUI to be started and stopped independently of the node. By default with this change, `bitcoin-gui` will check if a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` socket exists and try to connect to that. If that doesn't work, it will spawn a new node process and start up the same way it did before this PR.\n\nThe default `bitcoin-gui` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which tries to connect if possible as described above, and spawns a new `bitcoin-node` process if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to never connect to an existing node and always spawn a new one, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\n\nWith this PR, basic functionality works and gui instances can connect and disconnect from a running node. But there are rough edges: If a gui process doesn't shut down cleanly, the node can see unhandled IpcExceptions, and if node command line options are passed to `bitcoin-gui` and `bitcoin-gui` connects to an exiting bitcoin-node process instead of spawning a new one, the node options will be silently ignored. \n\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)\n\n---\n\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).",

      "title": "refactor: Add util::Result failure types and ability to merge result values",
      "body": "Add `util::Result` support for returning more error information and make use of it in [LoadChainstate method](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665/commits/0263614685582fed2290494f5233dbe038fc350c) as an initial application. Followup PRs [#25722](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25722) and [#29700](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700) use it more broadly to return errors and warnings from wallet and kernel functions as well.\r\n\r\nThis change adds two major features to the result class:\r\n\r\n- For better error handling, adds the ability to return a value on failure, not just a value on success. This is a key missing feature that makes the result class not useful for functions like `LoadChainstate()` which produce different errors that need to be handled differently [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Ability to return error values was actually present in the original implementation of [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218), but unfortunately removed in later iterations. See [design notes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/util::Result-design-notes).\r\n\r\n- For better error reporting, adds the ability to return warning messages and multiple errors, not just a single error string. This provides a way for functions to report errors and warnings in a standard way, and simplifies interfaces:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -virtual std::unique_ptr<Wallet> loadWallet(const std::string& name, bilingual_str& error, std::vector<bilingual_str>& warnings) = 0;\r\n    +virtual util::Result<std::unique_ptr<Wallet>> loadWallet(const std::string& name) = 0;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options, DatabaseStatus& status, bilingual_str& error);\r\n    +util::Result<std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase>, DatabaseError> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options);\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis change also makes some more minor improvements:\r\n\r\n- Smaller type size. `util::Result<int>` is 16 bytes, and `util::Result<void>` is 8 bytes. Previously both were 72 bytes.\r\n\r\n- Broader type compatibility. Supports noncopyable and nonmovable success and error types.\r\n\r\n### Comparison with `std::expected`\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `util::Result` class is useful for error reporting—returning translated, user-facing error strings—but not as useful for error handling, where callers need structured failure information to decide how to proceed. By contrast, `std::expected` / `util::Expected` (#34005, #34006) is good for error handling but less helpful for reporting. This PR closes the gap between the two classes.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, `std::expected` remains a good choice for lower-level functions or simple functions that fail in only a few well-defined ways. Meanwhile,\r\n\r\n- `Result` becomes a better choice for operations that can fail in many different ways—loading a wallet, connecting a block, etc.—where callers may want complete error traces, not just low-level errors without context or high-level errors without detail. (Followup [#25722](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25722) applies this to wallet-loading functions.) \r\n- `Result` can also be more useful than `expected` when merging status information from multiple calls. (Followup [#29700](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700) uses this to reliably propagate flush and fatal-error status from validation code that can internally trigger flushes or shutdowns.)\r\n- `Result` may also be a better choice than `std::expected` when returning pointer values. (Followup [#26022](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26022) adds a `ResultPtr` specialization that avoids double dereferencing.) \r\n- `Result` can be more efficient than `std::expected` when failures are rare but failure objects are large, since failure values are heap-allocated.\r\n\r\nThis PR effectively makes `Result` a superset of `expected`, making the representations compatible and allowing them to be used together.",

Instead of needing to be deferenced twice with `**result` or `(*result)->member`, it only needs to be dereferenced once with `*result` or `result->member`. Also when it is used in a boolean context, instead of evaluating to true when there is no error and the pointer is null, it evaluates to false so it is straightforward to determine whether the result points to something.\n\nThis PR is only partial a solution to #26004 because while it makes it easier to check for null pointer values, it does not make it impossible to return a null pointer value inside a successful result. It would be possible to enforce that successful results always contain non-null pointers by using a `not_null` type (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24423) in combination with `ResultPtr`, though.",

      "body": "Work is currently happening on #33689.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe current procedure for building the block filter index involves processing filters one at a time;\r\nReading blocks, undo data, and previous headers from disk sequentially.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new mechanism to perform the work concurrently. Dividing the filters\r\ngeneration workload among a pool of workers that can be configured by the user,\r\nsignificantly increasing the speed of the index construction process.\r\n\r\nThe same concurrent processing model has been applied to the transactions index as well.\r\n\r\nThe newly introduced init flag `-indexworkers=<n>` enables the concurrent sync\r\nbehavior.\r\nWhere \"n\" is the number of worker threads that will be spawned at startup to create ranges\r\nof block filters during the initial sync process. Destroying the workers pool once the\r\ninitial sync completes.\r\nNote: by default, the parallelized sync process is not enabled.\r\n\r\nNow the juicy part:\r\nIn my computer, with the node in debug mode and on IBD, with `-indexworkers=4`, the\r\nblock filter index generation took less than an hour. While, in master, the sync took more than 7 hours.\r\n\r\nImportant Note:\r\nAs the access to the block data on disk is protected by `cs_main`, this new feature runs substantially\r\nfaster when the node is not in IBD.\r\n\r\n#### Testing Notes:\r\n\r\n1. Sync your node without any index.\r\n2. Restart the node with one of the indexes (`-blockfilterindex` or `-txindex`) and `-connect=0` (to sync only the index, without running the net/validation threads. Since threads won't be competing for `cs_main`, this will give you a more accurate result).\r\n\r\n   You’ll see a \"[index name] is enabled at height [height]\" log entry once it finishes. Then it’s just a matter of subtracting the index startup time from the \"index synced\" log time.\r\n\r\n  Keep in mind that threads are shared among all indexes you start. So if you run both indexes at the same time, your benchmark results cannot be compared against single-index runs.\r\n\r\n#### Fuzz Test Coverage Report\r\nCoverage diff for the fuzz test can be found on https://brunoerg.xyz/bitcoin-core-coverage/26966/coverage_report/",

The external `libbitcoinkernel` library now re-uses the compiled objects from the internal libraries. \r\n\r\nThere is a trade-off to this. Since we don't manually export symbols from the kernel library yet, this would make the library unusable if `REDUCE_EXPORTS=ON`. For now this means that the patch here introduces a separate source file list for the external library that gets populated by the source files of its static dependents.",

This last part add the initial asmap data, implements the build changes and adds further documentation.\r\n\r\nCurrently an asmap file needs to be acquired by there user from some location or the user needs to generate one themselves. Then they need to move the file to the right place in datadir or pass the path to the file as `-asmap=PATH` in order to use the asmap feature. The change here allows for builds to embed asmap data into the bitcoind binary which makes it possible to use the feature without handling of the asmap file by the user. If the user starts bitcoind with `-asmap` the embedded data will be used for bucketing of nodes.\r\n\r\nThe data lives in the repository at `src/node/data/ip_asn.dat` and can be replaced with a new version at any time. The idea is that the data should be updated with every release. By default the data at that location is embedded into the binary but there is also a build option to prevent this (`-DWITH_EMBEDDED_ASMAP=OFF`). In this case the original behavior of the `-asmap` option is maintained.",

      "title": "validation: fetch block inputs on parallel threads 3x faster IBD",
      "body": "_Parts of this PR are isolated in independent smaller PRs to ease review:_\r\n\r\n* [x] _https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/34164_\r\n* [ ] _https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/34165_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR parallelizes fetching all input prevouts of a block during block connection, achieving over 3x faster IBD performance in some scenarios[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5].\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently, when fetching inputs in `ConnectBlock`, each input is fetched from the cache sequentially. A cache miss requires a round trip to the disk database to fetch the outpoint and insert it into the cache. Since the database is read-only during `ConnectBlock`, we can fetch all inputs of a block in parallel on multiple threads while connecting.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nWe introduce a new `CoinsViewCacheAsync` `CCoinsViewCache` subclass that manages worker threads to fetch block inputs in parallel. The block is passed to the `CoinsViewCacheAsync` view before entering `ConnectBlock`, which kicks off the worker threads to begin fetching the inputs. The view is then passed to `ConnectBlock` since it provides the same API as `CCoinsViewCache`. The cache returns fetched coins as they become available via the overridden `FetchCoin` method. If not available yet, the main thread also fetches coins as it waits.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Details\r\n\r\nThe `CoinsViewCacheAsync` implements a lock-free MPSC (Multiple Producer, Single Consumer) queue design:\r\n\r\n- **Work Distribution**: Collects all input prevouts into a queue and uses a barrier to start all worker threads simultaneously\r\n- **Synchronization**: Worker threads use an atomic counter to claim which inputs to fetch, and each input has an atomic flag to signal completion to the main thread\r\n- **Main Thread Processing**: The main thread waits for inputs in order and moves their `Coin` into the `cacheCoins` map as they become available.\r\n- **Work Stealing**: If the main thread catches up to the workers, it assists with fetching to maximize parallelism\r\n- **Completion**: All threads synchronize on a barrier via a `Reset` method, which ensures all threads are parked before proceeding\r\n\r\n### Safety and Correctness\r\n\r\n- The `CoinsViewCacheAsync` works on a block that has not been fully validated, but it does not interfere or modify any of the validation during `ConnectBlock`\r\n- It simply fetches inputs in parallel, which must be fetched before a transaction is validated anyways\r\n- **Invalid blocks**: If an invalid block is mined, the temporary cache is reset without being flushed. This is an improvement over the current behavior, where existing inputs are inserted into the main `CoinsTip()` cache when pulled through for an invalid block\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nBenchmarks show over 3x faster IBD performance in a cloud environment with network connected storage[^1], 3x faster IBD for an M4 Mac and up to 46% faster with directly connected storage[^2][^3][^4][^5]. The parallelization of expensive disk lookups provides significant speedup.\r\n\r\n[Flamegraphs show how the execution is changed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31132#issuecomment-3617315125).\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nInspired by [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18941#issuecomment-638553680).\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/34121.\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31132#issuecomment-3678847806\r\n[^2]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31132#pullrequestreview-3515011880\r\n[^3]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31132#issuecomment-3463894000\r\n[^4]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31132#pullrequestreview-3347436866\r\n[^5]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31132#issuecomment-3488760623",

      "title": "scripted-diff: Type-safe settings retrieval",
      "body": "This PR changes the way settings are registered and retrieved to provide more compile-time safety. Currently settings are [registered](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/03cff2c1421e5db59963eba1a845ef5dd318c275/src/init.cpp#L504) and [retrieved](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/03cff2c1421e5db59963eba1a845ef5dd318c275/src/init.cpp#L173) like:\n\n```c++\n// Register setting\nargsman.AddArg(\"-pid=<file>\", strprintf(\"Specify pid file. Relative paths will be prefixed by a net-specific datadir location. (default: %s)\", BITCOIN_PID_FILENAME), ArgsManager::ALLOW_ANY, OptionsCategory::OPTIONS);\n\n// Retrieve setting\nargs.GetPathArg(\"-pid\", BITCOIN_PID_FILENAME)\n```\n\nBut this is not ideal because nothing checks that setting names are spelled correctly, or that default values (`BITCOIN_PID_FILENAME`) are used consistently in the help string and retrieval sites, or that settings are retrieved with consistent types (bool, int, string, path, or list). This PR addresses these issues by adding setting [declarations](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/416860fc360b3d5aa1a0782ab8f8454b46e6d657/src/init_settings.h#L267-L270) which allow settings to be [registered](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/416860fc360b3d5aa1a0782ab8f8454b46e6d657/src/init.cpp#L484) and [retrieved](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/416860fc360b3d5aa1a0782ab8f8454b46e6d657/src/init.cpp#L164C38-L164C59) like:\n\n```c++\n// Declare setting\nusing PidSetting = common::Setting<\n    \"-pid=<file>\", fs::path, {.legacy = true},\n    \"Specify pid file. Relative paths will be prefixed by a net-specific datadir location. (default: %s)\">\n    ::DefaultFn<[] { return BITCOIN_PID_FILENAME; }>;\n\n// Register setting\nPidSetting::Register(argsman);\n\n// Retrieve setting\nPidSetting::Get(args)\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Suggestions for review\n\nAll the real changes in this PR are in the last scripted-diff commit:\n\n- [scripted-diff: Replace AddArgs / GetArgs calls with Setting Register / Get calls](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31260/commits/fc2591a35b0640adc0df686b0f8bed5f50ada9ce)\n\nIf you take a few minutes to look at the changes applied in this scripted-diff commit, you'll understand everything this PR is doing. A good place to start looking around in this commit is the generated [`src/init_settings.h`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/scripty/src/init_settings.h) file which declares the settings that get registered in [src/init.cpp](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/scripty/src/init.cpp). Then you can look at the surrounding diffs and see they are just replacing `AddArg` and `GetArg` calls.\n\nThe other notable commit is second commit, which implements the `Setting` class:\n\n- [common: Add Setting class to support typed Settings](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31260/commits/e1f016180746db0eebc2c2e1e0786f0cc5da8a43)\n\nThe other commits do minor things like moving code or updating linters. The python script that implements the scripted diff is a temporary artifact that gets deleted. The python script is complicated because it does things like parsing c++ code to extract help strings, and figuring out the right types to declare settings with so code compiles. But the entire scope of the script is to (1) generate Setting type definitions, (2) add #includes, and (3) replace `AddArg()` calls with `Register()` calls and `GetArg()` calls with `Get()` calls. So there is not much the script can actually do wrong without triggering build and test failures.\n\n---\n\n#### Extensions\n\nThis PR only adds the ability to declare individual settings with built-in types. It doesn't provide any new runtime behavior, but a branch in issue #22978 extends the `Setting` class implemented here to support runtime setting validation, additional types like `std::variant`, additional conversion options, custom types, custom validation, and groups of settings declared as options structs.\n\nThis change is mostly orthogonal to #16545. #16545 only provides runtime type checking while this PR only provides compile-time checking with no new runtime behavior. But this change does allow a nicer way of declaring types in #16545, using c++ types like `int` instead of flags like `ALLOW_INT`, or`std::vector<std::string>` instead of `ALLOW_STRING | ALLOW_LIST`.",

Generate build files with `-DENABLE_WAIT_FOR_DEBUGGER=ON` & build.\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_WAIT_FOR_DEBUGGER=ON && cmake --build build -j$(nproc)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Set breakpoints in the C++ code in your editor/IDE/debugger.\r\n\r\n3. Start a Python functional test with a debugger command such as:\r\n   - LLDB inside an already started Tmux pane (append ` -o continue` to the LLDB args to have the debugger continue automatically):\r\n     ```\r\n     ./build/test/functional/feature_loadblock.py --debug_runs 2 --debug_cmd \"tmux split-window -h lldb -p \\$PID\\$\"\r\n     ```\r\n   - Sublime Text Debugger, allows a running session to attach:\r\n     ```\r\n     ./build/test/functional/feature_loadblock.py --debug_runs 2 --debug_cmd \"subl --command \\\"debugger {\\\\\\\"action\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"start\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"configuration\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"lldb\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"request\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"attach\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"program\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"dummyprogram\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"pid\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\$PID\\$\\\\\\\"}}\\\"\"\r\n     ```\r\n   - Don't specify `--debug_cmd ...\\$PID\\$...`, instead have the test framework log which bitcoind PID you should manually attach to:\r\n     ```\r\n     ./build/test/functional/feature_loadblock.py --debug_runs 2\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n5. Experience how debugger hits breakpoints as the functional test executes RPCs.\r\n\r\nUsing `-debug_runs <RUN_INDEX>` often requires doing a dry-run of a functional test with `-ldebug` and examining the log to see which run index is the one we want to debug:\r\n```\r\n2025-...Z TestFramework.node0 (DEBUG): bitcoind started (run #1, node #0), waiting for RPC to come up\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Alternative usage\r\n\r\nTweak functional test code to specify `wait_for_debugger` when (re)starting a node:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-        self.restart_node(0)\r\n+        self.restart_node(0, wait_for_debugger=True)\r\n```\r\nWhile it can be messy to modify files while moving between commits, and cumbersome inside of loops, it might be more straightforward than `-debug_runs <RUN_INDEX>` in a given case.\r\n\r\n### *Needed before merge*\r\n\r\n- [ ] Testing on Mac to confirm -waitfordebugger on the C++ side behaves as expected.",

      "title": "kernel: Separate UTXO set access from validation functions",
      "body": "The current code makes it hard to call functions for checking the consensus-correctness of a block without having a full UTXO set at hand. This makes implementing features such as Utreexo and non-assumevalid swiftsync, where maintaining a full UTXO set defeats their purpose, through the kernel API difficult. Checks like the coinbase subsidy, or block sigops are only available through `ConnectBlock`, which requires a complete coins cache.\r\n\r\nSolve this by moving accessing coins and the responsibility of spending them out of `ConnectBlock` and into a new separate function called `SpendBlock`. Pass a block's spent coins through the existing `CBlockUndo` data structure to `ConnectBlock`. \r\n\r\nWhile the change is largely a refactor, some smaller behaviour changes were unavoidable. These should be highlighted in the commit messages. The last commit contains the most important part of the coins logic move, the commits before attempt to prepare it piecemeal.\r\n\r\nThis pull request was benchmarked on [benchcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-tools/benchcoin/pull/162), which showed no performance regression.

      "title": "(RFC) kernel: Replace leveldb-based BlockTreeDB with flat-file based store",
      "body": "Opening this PR mostly to get concept/approach feedback.\r\n\r\nThis is motivated by the kernel library, where the internal usage of leveldb is a limiting factor to its future use cases. Specifically it is not possible to share leveldb databases between two processes. A notable use-case for the kernel library is accessing and analyzing existing block data. Currently this can only be done by first shutting down the node writing this data. Moving away from leveldb opens the door towards doing this in parallel. A flat file based approach was chosen, since the requirements for persistence here are fairly simple (no deletion, constant-size entries). The change also offers better performance by making node startup faster, and has a smaller on-disk footprint, though this is negligible in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nThe BlockTreeStore introduces a new data format for storing block indexes and headers on disk. The class is very similar to the existing CBlockTreeDB, which stores the same data in a leveldb database. Unlike CBlockTreeDB, the data stored through the BlockTreeStore is directly serialized and written to flat .dat files. The storage schema introduced\r\nis simple. It relies on the assumption that no entry is ever deleted and that no duplicate entries are written. These assumptions hold for the current users of CBlockTreeDB.\r\n\r\nA write ahead ahead log and boolean flags as file existence checks ensure write atomicity. Every data entry is also given a crc32c checksum to detect data corruption.\r\n\r\nThe change also opens the door towards getting rid of having to reindex the block tree due to corruption (though switching from pruned -> un-pruned still requires extra logic). This would simplify a lot of kernel/validation code, as can be seen in this [commit](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commit/bfb2709e1d116d4e613601c3f0140f099530159d#diff-28f178018e05634ee3f8ddce3f4e0cec334ae69915cecf92be8299c749d8d470). The implementation here should be fairly robust against corruption (no parallel read/writes, no background compaction).\r\n\r\nAn alternative to this pull request, that could allow the same kernel feature, would be closing and opening the leveldb database only when reading and writing. This might incur a (negligible) performance penalty, but more importantly requires careful consideration of how to handle any contentions when opening, which might have complex side effects due to our current locking mode. It would also be possible to introduce an existing database with the required features for just the block tree, but that would introduce reliance on a new dependency and come with its own tradeoffs. For these reasons I chose this approach.",

If there are worker threads available the function instead only creates the checks and puts them into a vector. Aside from some shared pre-checks the multithreaded code path is much simpler compared to the rest. This dual use makes the function hard to grasp and its naming confusing.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors this code to be more readable and improves documentation aside from unifying the single threaded and the multithreaded cases by letting checkqueue handle single threaded script checking as well. The code is already suited for this and there seems to be not noticable performance overhead from this.",

This PR adds a script verification benchmark for P2TR key path spends accordingly, by generalizing the already existing one for P2WPKH spends.\r\n\r\nThis should make it easier to quantify potential performance improvements like e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1777, which allows to plug in our HW-optimized SHA256 functions to be used in libsecp256k1 (see the linked example commit https://github.com/furszy/bitcoin-core/commit/f68bef06d95a589859f98fc898dd80ab2e35eb39). IIRC from last CoreDev, the main speedup from this is expected for ECDSA signing though (as this involves quite a lot of hashing), but it still makes sense to have verification benchmarks available for both signature types as well.\r\n\r\n(An alternative way could be to add benchmarks for the signing/verifying member functions `CKey::Sign{,Schnorr}`, `CPubKey::Verify` and `XOnlyPubKey::VerifySchnorr` directly, if we prefer that.) \r\n\r\n[1] this claim can be practically verified by putting an `assert(false);` into `XOnlyPubKey::VerifySchnorr`: the three benchmarks crashing are `ConnectBlockAllSchnorr`, `ConnectBlockMixedEcdsaSchnorr` and `SignTransactionSchnorr` (as signing includes verification)",

Rather than creating a full wallet, the instruction could be changed to start with a blank wallet and only generate the default legacy descriptor. This avoids accidental use of single sig `p2sh-segwit` and `bech32` addresses.\r\n\r\n(I might do that in #32784, which introduces some other improvements to the tutorial. The situation is still not great; ideally the `importdescriptors` RPC is enhanced to detect when an `xpub` is a child of an hd key and then treats it as if an xpriv was imported.)\r\n\r\nBuilds on #29136.",

      "title": "wallet: Prepare for future upgrades by recording versions of last client to open and decrypt",
      "body": "When a wallet is automatically upgraded, we always do so in a way that allows the user to load their wallet in an older version. When the user loads their wallet into an upgraded version again, the wallet may not perform the automatic upgrade and end up with upgraded and non-upgraded material in the wallet.\r\n\r\nIf we write some information about the last client to open the wallet, we would be able to detect these upgrade-downgrade-upgrade situations and perform another upgrade if so. However, in order for this to work, we need to have implemented writing such information into versions prior to the ones which introduce new automatic upgrades.\r\n\r\nWe are already writing the CLIENT_VERSION into all wallets in a \"version\" record, although this record is not updated in the same way across all previous versions. Since v24.0, we are always updating the record when the client version differs, but prior to that, the record would only be updated when the client version is newer. Even so, we can use this record to store the last client version.\r\n\r\nThe first commit decouples the written client version from the node version. This aids in development of new features. The version is entirely decoupled from previous versions by requiring all versions to have bit 30 set, and the initial version being `0 | (1 << 30)`. The versions just need to be at least 299900, and forcing bit 30 to be set was an easy way to achieve this.\r\n\r\nHowever, using version numbers is not as flexible as feature flags, so the second commit introduces the concept of Wallet Client Features. These flags are distinct from the existing Wallet Feature Flags since they are conceptually different. These are written in a separate record, and the wallet client version is incremented to `(1 << 0) | (1 << 30)`.\r\n\r\nLastly, since some upgrades may need private keys and can only occur after the wallet is decrypted, the third commit also adds a last decrypted features flags record to record the features of the last client to decrypt the wallet.\r\n\r\nThe result is that we will now be able to detect a downgrade down to v24.0 and be able to implement in parallel multiple features that require automatic upgrades.",

      "title": "txgraph: deterministic optimal transaction order",
      "body": "Part of #30289.\r\n\r\nTxGraph's fundamental responsibility is deciding the order of transactions in the mempool. It relies on the `cluster_linearize.h` code to optimize it, but there can and often will be many different orderings that are essentially equivalent from a quality perspective, so we have to pick one. At a high level, the solution will involve one or more of:\r\n* Deciding based on **internal identifiers** (`Cluster::m_sequence`, `DepGraphIndex`). This is very simple, but risks leaking information about transaction receive order.\r\n* Deciding **randomly**, which is private, but may interfere with relay expectations, block propagation, and ability to monitor network behavior.\r\n* Deciding **based on txid**, which is private and deterministic, but risks incentivizing grinding to get an edge (though we haven't really seen such behavior).\r\n* Deciding **based on size** (e.g. prefer smaller transactions), which is somewhat related to quality, but not unconditionally (depending on mempool layout, the ideal ordering might call for smaller transactions first, last, or anywhere in between). It's also not a strong ordering as there can be many identically-sized transactions. However, if it were to encourage grinding behavior, incentivizing smaller transactions is probably not a bad thing.\r\n\r\nAs of #32545, the current behavior is primarily picking randomly, though inconsistently, as some code paths also use internal identifiers and size. #33335 sought to change it to use random (preferring size in a few places), with the downsides listed above.\r\n\r\nThis PR is an alternative to that, which changes the order to tie-break based on size everywhere possible, and use lowest-txid-first as final fallback. This is fully deterministic: for any given set of mempool transactions, if all linearized optimally, the transaction order exposed by TxGraph is deterministic.\r\n\r\nThe order of transactions within a chunk is tie-broken using:\r\n1. The output of `PostLinearize` (which improves sub-chunk order), using an initial linearization created using the rules 2-4 below.\r\n2. Individual transaction feerate (high to low)\r\n3. Individual transaction weight (small to large)\r\n4. Txid (low to high txid)\r\n\r\nThe order of chunks within a cluster is tie-broken using:\r\n1. Chunk feerate (high to low)\r\n2. Chunk weight (small to large)\r\n3. Max-txid (chunk with lowest maximum-txid first)\r\n\r\nThe order of chunks across clusters is tie-broken using:\r\n1. Feerate (high to low)\r\n2. Equal-feerate-chunk-prefix weight (small to large)\r\n3. Max-txid (chunk with lowest maximum-txid first)\r\n\r\nThe equal-feerate-chunk-prefix weight of a chunk C is defined as the sum of the weights of all chunks in the same cluster as C, with the same feerate as C, up to and including C itself, in linearization order (but excluding such chunks that appear after C). This is a well-defined approximation of sorting chunks from small to large across clusters, while remaining consistent with intra-cluster linearization order.\r\n",

      "body": "External signers such as Ledger, BitBox02 and Jade, when used with multisig, use [BIP388](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0388.mediawiki) to display (and constrain) descriptor policies to their users.\r\n\r\nAt least in the case of Ledger (no others so far, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33008#issuecomment-3165080503) this requires us to hold on to an hmac, which proves to the device that the user previously reviewed and approved it.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new RPC call `registerpolicy` which converts our descriptor(s) into a BIP388 policy (_partially implemented_), calls a new HWI method `register` (_implemented_) and stores the resulting HMAC (_implemented_).\r\n\r\nWhen signing a transaction using HWI's `signtx` it passes the HMAC along with the PSBT (_TODO_).\r\n\r\nFor convenience the HMAC can be retrieved via `getwalletinfo` (_implemented_). This is useful for scenario's where we can't (yet) complete a transaction via HWI calls.\r\n\r\nNote that the HMAC itself is not specified in BIP388 and may be different for different hardware vendors. So we'll store and echo any hex string the device gives us.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach to directly supporting BIP388 policies would be to pass the involved descriptors to HWI and have it figure out how to derive a policy.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n- make a multisig wallet with a Ledger or other [supported device](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0388.mediawiki#reference-implementation)\r\n  - try https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/91 if you're feeling adventurous, it includes this PR\r\n- install https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/pull/791 HWI branch\r\n- call `bitcoin rpc registerpolicy`\r\n- call `bitcoin rpc getwalletinfo` to see the hmac\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] derive policy using `Descriptor` class instead regex madness, implement all constraints\r\n- [ ] pass hmac along when signing\r\n\r\nDepends on:\r\n- [ ] HWI `register` command: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/pull/791\r\n- [ ] HWI optional `--hmac` argument for `signtx` (if set, bypass the current auto-registration workaround)\r\n\r\nPotential followups:\r\n- pass hmac along when displaying an address.

This PR lays the groundwork for removing `cs_main` locks by enabling consistent snapshots without holding locks.\r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\nSee full design document: [CChain Concurrency](https://github.com/alexanderwiederin/bitcoinkernel-proposals/blob/master/cchain-concurrency.md) (**Out of date after mutex removal** - will be updated soon)\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** Split chain into base (bulk of history) + tail (recent ~1,000 blocks). Use nested `stlab::copy_on_write` so updates copy only tail, keeping base shared.\r\n\r\n*Thanks to @purplekarrot for pointing me to `stlab::copy_on_write` and making design suggestions.*\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Implements copy-on-write based CChain with value semantics\r\n- Removes `cs_main` locks from RPC methods (where possible)\r\n- All validation locks remain in place (`cs_main` still held during validation)\r\n- API unchanged - backward compatible\r\n\r\n### Request for Comments\r\n\r\n1. Is the nested copy-on-write architecture sound?\r\n2. Is `MAX_TAIL_SIZE = 1000` reasonable?\r\n3. What are the concerns for future lock removal?\r\n4. Is the added complexity worth the benefit?",

      "body": "This PR implements the first step of #33758 by adding a cache layer for node block templates.\r\n\r\nThe cache stores newly created block templates along with their configuration options. When clients request a block template, they specify an optional template age limit in `MillisecondsDouble`:\r\n\r\n- If template age limit is `nullopt`, we create a new template and return it without adding it to the cache.\r\n- If a matching template (block template with identical block creation options) exists in the cache and hasn't exceeded the age limit, the cached version is returned.\r\n- If no matching template exists or the age limit has been exceeded, a new template is generated, cached, and returned. When evicting stale templates, we assume no duplicates exist since templates are evicted as soon as their age limit is reached or exceeded.\r\n\r\nThe cache maintains a configurable maximum size (default: 10 templates). When this limit is exceeded, the oldest template is evicted after each insertion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCache lookup requires an exact match on ALL `BlockAssembler::Options` fields. While some fields (e.g., `test_block_validity`, `print_modified_fee`, `coinbase_output_script`) could be ignored for cache reuse, they mainly differ in tests and benchmarks. We keep the logic simple and accept cache misses in those cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cache enforces at most one template per set of options. When searching for a match in `getCachedTemplate()`, if a template with matching options is found but has exceeded the age limit, it's immediately evicted before returning `nullptr`. This ensures no duplicate options exist in the cache. A `SanityCheck()` method verifies this invariant in tests by checking all cached entries for duplicates.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cache subscribes to the validation interface and clears itself when blocks are connected (to non-historical chainstate to avoid clearing during assumeutxo background validation) or disconnected from the active chain (during reorgs), preventing stale or invalid templates from being served.\r\n\r\n`GetBlockTemplate()` uses double-checked locking: it first checks the cache with only `m_mutex` held, then if there's a miss, acquires both `cs_main` and `m_mutex` to create the template. Before creating, it checks again since another thread might have added a template while locks were released. \r\n\r\nThis PR removes an unused `node/context.h` import from miner to prevent a circular dependency when exposing the block template cache to the node context.",

This inadvertently exposes their headers to the compiler via `-I` flags brought in by other dependencies (e.g., `libevent` or `sqlite`). This \"include path pollution\" masks missing dependencies in the build configuration. While the build might succeed by accident due to this overlap, it creates a fragile state. If the overlapping library is removed, the build will break, or, worse, the compiler may silently fall back to the host system's default paths (e.g., `/usr/include`).\r\n\r\nThis PR improves build system security and hygiene by enforcing strict, distinguished include paths for header-only dependencies.

When strings moved within the sorted message list, IDs shifted, creating large diffs and making translation platforms treat unchanged strings as new.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches XLF `<trans-unit id=...>` values to stable IDs derived from a SHA256 hash of the message context and source text.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33224#issuecomment-3234820665, any change that moves a translatable string within the sorted messages can renumber subsequent entries when IDs are sequential.\r\n\r\nSome English texts can appear in multiple places (e.g. “Clear”) with different meanings depending on the Qt context. To avoid collisions, the hash includes the `<group resname=...>` context.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nThe `translate` target already runs `contrib/devtools/stabilize_xlf_ids.py`. Instead of trying to preserve/renumber `_msg<N>` IDs by matching old/new units, the script now rewrites every `<trans-unit id>` to:\r\n\r\n- `sha256(resname + \"\\0\" + source-text)` (hex)\r\n- keeping the existing plural `[N]` suffix for plural forms\r\n\r\nThe script also checks for duplicate IDs and aborts if any are detected.\r\n\r\nNote: this is a one-time mass change from `_msg<N>` IDs to hashes; after that, rerunning `translate` on an unchanged tree should not churn IDs.\r\n\r\nWith this PR applied, IDs become stable hashes so ordering changes no longer cause renumbering churn.\r\n\r\n### Reproducer\r\n\r\nYou can test the replacer by changing any translatable text:\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp b/src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp\r\n--- a/src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp\t(revision a38b8cf788922174538161cda81ce28f2ac462ec)\r\n+++ b/src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp\t(date 1767310724675)\r\n@@ -258,7 +258,7 @@\r\n     connect(modalOverlay, &ModalOverlay::triggered, tabGroup, &QActionGroup::setEnabled);\r\n \r\n     overviewAction = new QAction(platformStyle->SingleColorIcon(\":/icons/overview\"), tr(\"&Overview\"), this);\r\n-    overviewAction->setStatusTip(tr(\"Show general overview of wallet\"));\r\n+    overviewAction->setStatusTip(tr(\"Show general overview of Wallet\"));\r\n     overviewAction->setToolTip(overviewAction->statusTip());\r\n     overviewAction->setCheckable(true);\r\n     overviewAction->setShortcut(QKeySequence(QStringLiteral(\"Alt+1\")));\r\n```\r\nand regenerating the translations\r\n```bash\r\ncmake --preset dev-mode -DWITH_USDT=OFF && cmake --build build_dev_mode --target translate\r\n```\r\nYou will notice that the new text moved to a different place with a different hash, but all other messages retained their IDs.",

      "title": "blocks: add `-reobfuscate-blocks` argument to enable (de)obfuscating existing blocks",
      "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nRecent discussions highlighted that many nodes which synced before Bitcoin Core v28 have their block and undo files stored effectively in the clear (zero XOR key). This patch adds a simple, resumable maintenance tool to obfuscate previously raw block files, rotate an existing key to a fresh random one, or de-obfuscate (set key to zero) if consciously chosen, all without requiring resync. The operation can be cancelled and restarted safely.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nThe new startup option `-reobfuscate-blocks[=VALUE]` accepts either 16 hex characters as an exact 8-byte XOR key (little-endian in-memory layout) or a boolean to generate a random 64-bit key. e.g. `-reobfuscate-blocks=0000000000000000` sets the key to zero, effectively removing obfuscation.\r\n\r\nIf we detect unobfuscated blocks at start time we suggest this new option in a warning.\r\n\r\nAt startup, we iterate over all undo and block files (grouping the block and undo files for more uniform iteration), read them with the old XOR key and write them back with the new key (`<name>.reobfuscated`). The implementation actually combines the two keys and reads directly into the new obfuscated version to only do a single iteration over the data. This works if the original blocks aren't obfuscated or if the new blocks aren't or if both are.\r\nAfter successful write, we immediately delete the old file. Once all files are staged, we rename them back and atomically swap `xor.dat.reobfuscated` → `xor.dat` and continue operation.\r\n\r\nWe log the old and new keys and print progress roughly per-percent as files complete (i.e. max 100 progress logs).\r\n\r\n### Constraints\r\n\r\n* Re-obfuscation resumes automatically (detected via `xor.dat.reobfuscated`) even without the flag. In worst-case a crash should only force us to redo previous work.\r\n* Single-threaded, processing one file at a time to keep code simple and avoid complexity of interleaving renames and key swaps across threads.\r\n* Fast in practice with sequential read/modify/write per blockfile - after recent obfuscation vectorization, this path is very quick.\r\n\r\n### Reproducer\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncmake -B build -DBUILD_GUI=ON && cmake --build build -j$(nproc)\r\n# command line\r\n./build/bin/bitcoind -reobfuscate-blocks -stopatheight=1\r\n# same with GUI\r\n./build/bin/bitcoin-qt -reobfuscate-blocks -stopatheight=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Single-threaded Performance\r\n\r\n cpu                 | hdd/ssd | block count | size    | files  | time (min) | blocks/min \r\n---------------------|---------|-------------|---------|--------|------------|------------\r\n Apple M4 Max laptop | SSD     | ~909k       | ~707 GB | 9,982  | 8.4        | 146,613    \r\n Intel Core i9       | SSD     | ~909k       | ~725 GB | 10,238 | 23.1       | 39,351     \r\n Raspberry Pi 5      | SSD     | ~914k       | ~728 GB | 10,276 | 72.78      | 12,558     \r\n Intel Core i7       | HDD     | ~909k       | ~720 GB | 10,156 | 208.7      | 4,356      \r\n Raspberry Pi 4B     | HDD     | ~915k       | ~730 GB | 10,304 | 1467       | 624        \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSimilar work:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32451\r\n* https://github.com/andrewtoth/blocks-xor\r\n",

      "title": "[DO NOT MERGE] Erlay: bandwidth-efficient transaction relay protocol (Full implementation)",
      "body": "Erlay Project Tracking: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30249\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is a full implementation of Erlay. Its purpose is to check the integrity and correctness of the implementation against changes/additions that may originate from the review process and/or rebases on top of newer functionality.\r\n\r\nThis is not to be merged. Functionality will be spread across multiple smaller PRs to ease the review process.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Approach \r\n\r\nThe implementation approach builds on the following assumptions:\r\n\r\n- Fanout (the current relay method) is faster than Erlay, but less bandwidth efficient\r\n- Fanout is optimal if the node we want to announce a certain transaction doesn't know about it (but of course, we don't have that information)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general approach works as follows:\r\n\r\nReconciliation is used alongside fanout to relay transactions across the network. For Erlay nodes, the relay method will be decided per-transaction, instead of per connection, meaning that Erlay connections will do both fanout and reconciliation depending on the transaction (legacy connections will do only fanout, obviously).\r\n\r\nThe parameters selected for fanout are minimized to maximize the bandwidth saving. The current selected defaults are 4 outbound peers and 10% of inbounds. The relay logic depends on the type of connection and how the transaction has been received:\r\n\r\n- For outbound connections, if the transaction was received via fanout (or originates in us), we fanout until up to N peers know about it. We do this by checking the `m_tx_inventory_known_filter`, so their announcements also count. If the transaction was received via reconciliation, we simply reconcile with the rest of our peers.\r\n- For inbounds, we select 10% of our connections and rotate that selection periodically.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning for this is trying to guess how far the transaction has made it into the network with imperfect information. Knowing that fanout is faster than reconciliation, we want to have a higher fanout rate at the very beginning of the propagation, to get as far as we can, being fully efficient. This can be tied to how many of our peers know about the transaction already. Once the transaction is sufficiently spread, we can just reconcile it with the rest of our peers.\r\nThis does not apply to inbounds, as they are not trusted, and the metric will be easily abused, plus it may be used to leak transaction origin information. For them, we just keep a low fanout rate.\r\n\r\n## Testing and simulating\r\n\r\nThe last two commits of this PR are currently for simulation only. They allow to easily config the inbound/outbound fanout rate without having to recompile the code, and make full reconciliation more efficient.\r\n",

      "title": "argsman, cli: GNU-style command-line option parsing (allows options after non-option arguments)",
      "body": "This PR simplifies the argument parsing logic and resolves practical issues for `bitcoin-cli` and similar binaries (e.g. `bitcoin-wallet`) making their usage more consistent and predictable, enabling valid patterns such as mixing commands with wallet- or RPC-specific options—without relying on argument ordering quirks.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>What's changed in ArgsManager that allows the above.</summary>\r\n\r\n- Previously, `ArgsManager` stopped interpreting options once a non-option argument was encountered (non-GNU parsing). For example:\r\n\r\n        bitcoind -a -b param -c\r\n\r\n  would ignore `-c` because it followed the non-option argument `param`. In some cases '-c' is interpreted as an argument for 'param', producing unexpected behavior (eg empty arrays for listtransactions command).\r\n\r\n- This PR changes the behavior so that options following non-option argument are recognized and processed (GNU parsing). This is needed for workflows for tools like CLI where command arguments may be followed by wallet- or RPC-specific\r\noptions, e.g.:\r\n\r\n        bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"\" listtransactions -rpcwallet=mywallet\r\n    \r\n        bitcoin-cli getaddressinfo <address> -rpcwallet=mywallet\r\n\r\n- (other binaries could also benefit from this change,  e.g. `bitcoin-wallet`)\r\n\r\n        bitcoin-wallet create -wallet=newname\r\n\r\n- Invalid options passed after non-options will be treated as RPC arguments that begin with a `-` character (so no\r\nbehavioural change against `master`), e.g.:\r\n\r\n        bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=/tmp/btc createwallet -mywallet\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"-mywallet\"\r\n        }\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Before and after outputs running RPC commands from <code>CLI</code>/ <code>bitcoin-cli</code>.</summary><ul>\r\n     <li><details><summary>wallet commands using <code>CLI</code>:</summary><ul> \r\n           <li><details><summary><code>getaddressinfo</code></summary><ul>\r\n           <li>before/ <code>master</code>\r\n\r\n```\r\n./build_master/bin/bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=/tmp/btc getaddressinfo bcrt1qrnz5xlcwz5d85n3fag6v0vc4lryjc90jhqtpsh -rpcwallet=nonExistent\r\nerror message:\r\ngetaddressinfo \"address\"\r\n...\r\n```\r\n</li>\r\n           <li>after\r\n\r\n```\r\n./build/bin/bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=/tmp/btc getaddressinfo bcrt1qrnz5xlcwz5d85n3fag6v0vc4lryjc90jhqtpsh -rpcwallet=nonExistent\r\nerror code: -18\r\nerror message:\r\nRequested wallet does not exist or is not loaded\r\n```\r\n\r\n</li>\r\n           </ul></details></li>\r\n           <li><details><summary><code>listtransactions</code></summary><ul>\r\n           <li>before/ <code>master</code>\r\n\r\n```\r\n./build_master/bin/bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=/tmp/btc listtransactions -rpcwallet=nonExistent\r\n[\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n</li>\r\n           <li>after\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n./build/bin/bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=/tmp/btc listtransactions -rpcwallet=nonExistent\r\nerror code: -18\r\nerror message:\r\nRequested wallet does not exist or is not loaded\r\n```\r\n\r\n</li>\r\n           </ul></details></li>\r\n           <li><details><summary>any command that needs an option to be specifed, it can be added at the end directly instead of before the command</summary><ul>\r\n           <li>before/ <code>master</code>\r\n\r\n```\r\n./build_master/bin/bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=/tmp/btc listtransactions\r\nerror code: -19\r\nerror message:\r\nMultiple wallets are loaded.

      "title": "refactor: optimize block index comparisons (1.4-6.8x faster)",
      "body": "### Context\r\nThe comparator is often called either directly or for the sorting of [setBlockIndexCandidates](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.h#L637), a red-black tree-set containing valid block headers where the comparator is invoked extensively.\r\nBesided the sorted set usages, the comparator is used directly in `Chainstate` in `FindMostWorkChain`, `PruneBlockIndexCandidates`, `ActivateBestChain` and `InvalidateBlock`; and in `ChainstateManager` in `LoadBlockIndex`, `CheckBlockIndex`, `ActivateSnapshot` and `PopulateAndValidateSnapshot`.\r\n\r\nIt was profiled during the investigation of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33618#issuecomment-3402229976. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTo ensure the optimized implementations are both fast and correct, the first commit adds a dedicated benchmark to measure `CBlockIndexWorkComparator` performance, and the second commit adds randomized tests comparing the new implementation with the original one.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\n> GCC 15.0.1:\r\n\r\n* `CBlockIndexWorkComparator`: 100,772,511 cmp/s → 656,674,205 cmp/s = 6.51x faster\r\n* `CheckBlockIndex`: 9,091 ops/s → 14,765 ops/s = 1.62x faster\r\n\r\n> Clang 22.0.0:\r\n\r\n* `CBlockIndexWorkComparator`: 100,451,893 cmp/s → 683,414,234 cmp/s = 6.8x faster\r\n* `CheckBlockIndex`: 10,322 ops/s → 14,376 ops/s = 1.39x faster\r\n\r\nSee https://corecheck.dev/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/33637 for the CI's `CheckBlockIndex` performance.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>gcc and clang

      "body": "This has been a recent discovery; the general thread pool class created for #26966, cleanly \r\nintegrates into the HTTP server. It simplifies init, shutdown and requests execution logic.\r\nReplacing code that was never unit tested for code that is properly unit and fuzz tested.\r\nAlthough our functional test framework extensively uses this RPC interface (that’s how\r\nwe’ve been ensuring its correct behavior so far - which is not the best).\r\n\r\nThis clearly separates the responsibilities:\r\nThe HTTP server now focuses solely on receiving and dispatching requests, while ThreadPool handles\r\nconcurrency, queuing, and execution.\r\n\r\nThis will also allows us to experiment with further performance improvements at the task queuing and\r\nexecution level, such as a lock-free structure or task prioritization or any other implementation detail\r\nlike coroutines in the future, without having to deal with HTTP code that lives on a different layer.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThe rationale behind introducing the ThreadPool first is to be able to easily cherry-pick it across different\r\nworking paths. Some of the ones that are benefited from it are #26966 for the parallelization of the indexes\r\ninitial sync, #31132 for the parallelization of the inputs fetching procedure, #32061 for the libevent replacement,\r\nthe kernel API #30595 (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30595#discussion_r2413702370) to avoid blocking validation among others use cases not publicly available.\r\n\r\nNote 2:\r\nI could have created a wrapper around the existing code and replaced the `WorkQueue` in a subsequent\r\ncommit, but it didn’t seem worth the extra commits and review effort. The `ThreadPool` implements\r\nessentially the same functionality in a more modern and cleaner way.",

Providing `prevector::operator<=>` allows classes that are implemented in terms of `prevector` to use the compiler provided `operator<=>`.\r\n\r\nHowever, **there is a breaking change**!\r\n\r\nThe old implementation claims to be a drop-in replacement for `std::vector`. However, the implementation for `operator<` is different when comparing two vectors of different length, as can be presented with the following code:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    auto const v12 = std::vector{1, 2};\r\n    auto const v3 = std::vector{3};\r\n\r\n    auto const pv12 = prevector<4, int>(v12.begin(), v12.end());\r\n    auto const pv3 = prevector<4, int>(v3.begin(), v3.end());\r\n\r\n    assert((v12 < v3) == (pv12 < pv3));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the old implementation of `prevector`, the assertion fails. With my change, it passes.\r\nI ask the reviewers to confirm whether this change in behavior is acceptable or not.",

The variable that keeps track of this, within `CBlockIndex` is `nSequenceId`, which is not persisted over restarts. This means that when a node is restarted, all blocks loaded from disk are defaulted the same `nSequenceId`: 0. \r\nNow, when trying to decide what chain is best on loading blocks from disk, the previous tiebreaker rule is not decisive anymore, so the `CBlockIndexWorkComparator` has to default to its last rule: whatever block is loaded first (has a smaller memory address). \r\n\r\nThis means that if multiple same work tip candidates were available before restarting the node, it could be the case that the selected chain tip after restarting does not match the one before.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the way `nSequenceId` is initialized is changed to:\r\n\r\n- 0 for blocks that belong to the previously known best chain\r\n- 1 to all other blocks loaded from disk",

      "body": "A test that is added as part of #30455 uncovered this issue: The `GuessVerificationProgress` function is used during during descriptor import and relies on `m_chain_tx_count`. In #29370 an [`Assume` was added](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29370/commits/0fd915ee6bef63bb360ccc5c039a3c11676c38e3) expecting the `m_chaint_tx_count` to be set. However, as the test uncovered, `GuessVerificationProgress` is called with background sync blocks that have `m_chaint_tx_count = 0` when they have not been downloaded and processed yet.\r\n\r\nThe simple fix is to remove the `Assume`. Users should not be thrown off by the `Internal bug detected` error. The behavior of `importdescriptor` is kept consistent with the behavior for blocks missing due to pruning.\r\n\r\nThe test by alfonsoromanz is cherry-picked here to show that the [CI errors](https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5110045812195328?logs=ci#L2535) should be fixed by this change.\r\n\r\nThis PR also improves error messages returned by the `importdescriptors` and `rescanblockchain` RPCs. The error message now changes depending on the situation of the node, i.e. if pruning is happening or an assumutxo backgroundsync is active.",

      "title": "net: Fix Discover() not running when using -bind=0.0.0.0:port",
      "body": "  This PR fixes two related issues with address discovery when using explicit bind addresses in Bitcoin Core:\r\n\r\n  -  #31293\r\n  -  #31336\r\n\r\nWhen using `-bind=0.0.0.0:port` (or `-bind=::`), the `Discover()` function was not being executed because the code only checked the `bind_on_any` flag. This led to two problems:\r\n- The node would not discover its own local addresses if an explicit \"any\" bind was used.\r\n- The functional test `feature_bind_port_discover.py` would fail, as it expects local addresses to be discovered in these cases.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n1. Checks both `bind_on_any` and any bind addresses using `IsBindAny()`\r\n   Ensures `Discover()` runs when binding to 0.0.0.0 or ::, even if specified explicitly.\r\n2. Ensures correct address discovery\r\n   The node will now discover its own addresses when using explicit \"any\" binds, matching user expectations and fixing the test.\r\n3. Maintains backward compatibility\r\n   The semantic meaning of `bind_on_any` is preserved as defined in `net.h`:  \r\n   > \"True if the user did not specify -bind= or -whitebind= and thus we should bind on 0.0.0.0 (IPv4) and :: (IPv6)\"\r\n4. Updates the test to use dynamic ports\r\n   The functional test `feature_bind_port_discover.py` is updated to use dynamic ports instead of hardcoded ones, improving reliability.\r\n\r\nHow this PR Differs from #31492\r\n\r\n- Preserves the semantic meaning of `bind_on_any` (see `net.h`).\r\n- Uses a simpler approach: checks `IsBindAny()` on bind addresses, without modifying `GetListenPort()`.\r\n- Avoids code duplication with `DefaultOnionServiceTarget()`.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n- Implementation follows the approach proposed in my [review comment on #31492](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31492#issuecomment-2941773645).\r\n\r\nCloses #31293\r\n\r\nThe #31336 has the overall test failure and requires both this PR and #33362 to be fully resolved.\r\n",

      "body": "_Parts of this PR are isolated in independent smaller PRs to ease review:_\r\n\r\n* [x] _https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420_\r\n* [x] _https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33454_\r\n* [x] _https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33567_\r\n* [x] _https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33793_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections, or to IPv4/IPv6 peers but through the Tor network.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * opened to Tor or I2P peers or IPv4/IPv6 via the Tor proxy\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few peers. Keep doing this until we receive back this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from one of our ordinary peers, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- INV/TX --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- GETDATA/TX ----< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to a few (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after some time we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>How to test this?</summary>\r\n\r\nThank you, @stratospher and @andrewtoth!\r\n\r\nStart `bitcoind` with

Have the `submitpackage` RPC do the private broadcast as well, [draft diff in the comment below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415#pullrequestreview-2972293733), thanks ismaelsadeeq!\r\n* Add some stats via RPC, so that the user can better monitor what is going on during and after the broadcast. Currently this can be done via the debug log, but that is not convenient.\r\n* Make the private broadcast storage, currently in peerman, persistent over node restarts.\r\n* Add (optional) random delay before starting to broadcast the transaction in order to avoid correlating unrelated transactions based on the time when they were broadcast. Suggested independently of this PR [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30471).\r\n* Consider periodically sending transactions that did not originate from the node as decoy, discussed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415#discussion_r2035414972).\r\n* Consider waiting for peer's FEEFILTER message and if the transaction that was sent to the peer is below that threshold, then assume the peer is going to drop it. Then use this knowledge to retry more aggressively with another peer, instead of the current 10 min. See [comment below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415#issuecomment-3258611648).\r\n* It may make sense to be able to override the default policy -- eg so submitrawtransaction can go straight to the mempool and relay, even if txs are normally privately relayed. See [comment below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415#issuecomment-3427086681).\r\n* As a side effect we have a new metric available - the time it takes for a transaction to reach a random node in the network (from the point of view of the private broadcast recipient the tx originator is a random node somewhere in the network). This can be useful for monitoring, unrelated to privacy characteristics of this feature.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

This results in a race of CPU miners broadcasting blocks at exactly the second that it's acceptable. This race is so intense that CPU miners have figured out sending empty blocks, as they propagate faster than those that contain transactions, resulting in a network where transactions are confirmed at only the remaining ASIC blocks, that have ~1 hour average block times.                                                                                                     \r\n                                                                                                                                            \r\n  After the fork:                                                                                                                           \r\n  - Min-difficulty blocks will no longer be allowed                                                                                         \r\n  - Difficulty resets to 1,000,000 (not 1, to avoid a block storm of thousands of blocks in seconds)                                        \r\n  - Normal difficulty retargeting resumes                                                                                                   \r\n                                                                                                                                            \r\n  ## Changes                                                                                                                                \r\n                                                                                                                                            \r\n  - Add `nMinDifficultyBlocksForkHeight` consensus parameter (default 0 = disabled)                                                         \r\n  - Set fork height to 151,200 for testnet4 (epoch 75 boundary, ~31,000 blocks from current height ~120,000)                                \r\n  - Modify `GetNextWorkRequired()` to disable min-difficulty rule and reset difficulty at fork                                              \r\n  - Modify `PermittedDifficultyTransition()` to enforce the new rules                                                                       \r\n  - Modify `WaitAndCreateNewBlock()` in miner to respect the fork                                                                           \r\n  - Add unit tests covering pre-fork, at-fork, and post-fork behavior                                                                       \r\n                                                                                                                                            \r\n  ## Test Plan                                                                                                                              \r\n                                                                                                                                            \r\n  - `./build/bin/test_bitcoin --run_test=pow_tests` - all 21 tests pass                                                                     \r\n                                                                                                                                            \r\n  ## Discussion                                                                                                                             \r\n                                                                                                                                            \r\n  [bitcoin-dev mailing list thread #1](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/iVLHJ1HWhoU)\r\n  [bitcoin-dev mailing list thread #2](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/Jsv1VYpewuU)     \r\n  [Bitcointalk thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5569103.0)     ",

This simplifies downstream mining software (including Stratum v2), avoids forcing clients to strip or ignore data we generate, and reduces the risk of incompatibilities if future soft forks add required commitments to the `scriptSig`.\r\n\r\nExisting behavior is preserved for RPCs, tests, regtest, and internal mining by explicitly opting in to the dummy `extraNonce` where needed (e.g. to satisfy `bad-cb-length` at low heights), so consensus rules and test coverage are unchanged. The remainder of the PR consists of small comment fixes, naming clarifications, and test cleanups to make the intent and behavior clearer.",

Let's add generatetomany in case you want to split up the coinbase among multiple addresses, similar to how the \"sendtoaddress\" and \"sendmany\" commands both exist and let you send money to (1) one address or (2) multiple addresses. The generatetomany command would be particularly useful for simulating protocols that send money to multiple recipients directly from a coinbase, as several pools do now, like ocean and braidpool.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n- ~Needs release note~\r\n- ~Changes on `generateblock` are not backwards compatible as now it takes an array of outputs instead a single output. This should not be critical as it is a test RPC.~ ",

      "title": "refactor: disentangle miner startup defaults from runtime options",
      "body": "The interaction between node startup options like `-blockreservedweight` and runtime options, especially those passed via IPC, is confusing.\r\n\r\nThey're combined in `BlockAssembler::Options`, which this PR gets rid of in favour of two distinct structs:\r\n\r\n1. `BlockCreateOptions`: used by interface clients. As before, IPC clients have access to a safe / sane subset, whereas RPC and test code can use all fields.\r\n2. `MiningArgs`: these are set once during node startup\r\n\r\nBoth structs have a member for the maximum block height, which is not a problem since they're different structs. The one on `MiningArgs` (`block_max_weight`) matches `-maxblockheight` and is left alone. The one on `BlockCreateOptions` (`block_max_weight`) is an optional, it's set by `ApplyMiningDefaults` only if empty. \r\n\r\nThis all happens in the last commit and requires some preparation to keep things easy to review.\r\n\r\nWe get rid of `BlockAssembler::Options` but this is used in many tests. Since large churn is inevitable, we might as well switch all tests, bench and fuzzers over to the Mining interface. The first (non-base) commit does that, dramatically reducing direct use of `BlockAssembler`. Two exceptions are documented in the commit message. Because `test_block_validity` wasn't available via the interface and the block_assemble benchmark needs it, it's moved from `BlockAssembler::Options` to `BlockCreateOptions` (still not exposed via IPC).\r\n\r\nWe need access to mining related defaults and structs from both the miner and node initialization code. To avoid having to pull in all of `BlockAssembler` for the latter, the second commit introduces `node/mining.h` and moves constants and structs there from `src/node/types.h` (`BlockCreateOptions`, `BlockWaitOptions`, `BlockCheckOptions`) and `src/node/miner.h` (`DEFAULT_PRINT_MODIFIED_FEE`).\r\n\r\nI considered also moving `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_WEIGHT`, `DEFAULT_BLOCK_RESERVED_WEIGHT`, `MINIMUM_BLOCK_RESERVED_WEIGHT` and `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MIN_TX_FEE` there from `policy.h`, since they are distinct from relay policy and not needed by the kernel. But this seems more appropriate for a follow-up and requires additional discussion.\r\n\r\nThe meat and potatoes of this PR is split between the three last commits for easier review:\r\n\r\n1. Adds `node/mining_args.{h,cpp}` and move the options checking out of `init.cpp`, without adding storage\r\n2. Add `block_max_weight` to `BlockCreateOptions` as explained above\r\n3. Introduce the `MiningArgs` struct, add it to the `NodeContext`, expand `mining_args.cpp` to store it, pass it to `BlockAssembler`, etc.\r\n\r\nI kept variable renaming and other formatting changes to a minimum to ease review with `--color-moved=dimmed-zebra`.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on the bug fix in:\r\n- [ ] #33965\r\n\r\nOnce that is merged, this PR should not change behaviour.",

      "title": "kernel: Introduce C header API",
      "body": "This is a first attempt at introducing a C header for the libbitcoinkernel library that may be used by external applications for interfacing with Bitcoin Core's validation logic. It currently is limited to operations on blocks. This is a conscious choice, since it already offers a lot of powerful functionality, but sits just on the cusp of still being reviewable scope-wise while giving some pointers on how the rest of the API could look like.\r\n\r\nThe current design was informed by the development of some tools using the C header:\r\n\r\n* A re-implementation (part of this pull request) of [bitcoin-chainstate](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/bitcoin-chainstate.cpp).\r\n* A re-implementation of the python [block linearize](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/linearize) scripts: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/kernelLinearize \r\n* A silent payment scanner: https://github.com/josibake/silent-payments-scanner\r\n* An electrs index builder: https://github.com/josibake/electrs/commits/electrs-kernel-integration\r\n* A rust bitcoin node: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/kernel-node\r\n* A reindexer: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/kernelApi_Reindexer\r\n\r\nThe library has also been used by other developers already:\r\n\r\n* A historical block analysis tool: https://github.com/ismaelsadeeq/mining-analysis\r\n* A swiftsync hints generator: https://github.com/theStack/swiftsync-hints-gen\r\n* Fast script validation in floresta: https://github.com/vinteumorg/Floresta/pull/456\r\n* A swiftsync node implementation: https://github.com/2140-dev/swiftsync/tree/master/node\r\n\r\nNext to the C++ header also made available in this pull request, bindings for other languages are available here: \r\n\r\n* Rust: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/rust-bitcoinkernel\r\n* Python: https://github.com/stickies-v/py-bitcoinkernel \r\n* Go: https://github.com/stringintech/go-bitcoinkernel\r\n* Java: https://github.com/yuvicc/java-bitcoinkernel\r\n\r\nThe rust bindings include unit and fuzz tests for the API.\r\n\r\nThe header currently exposes logic for enabling the following functionality:\r\n* Feature-parity with the now deprecated libbitcoin-consensus\r\n* Optimized sha256 implementations that were not available to previous users of libbitcoin-consensus thanks to a static kernel context\r\n* Full support for logging as well as control over categories and severity\r\n* Feature parity with the existing experimental bitcoin-chainstate\r\n* Traversing the block index as well as using block index entries for reading block and undo data.\r\n* Running the chainstate in memory\r\n* Reindexing (both full and chainstate-only)\r\n* Interrupting long-running functions\r\n\r\nThe pull request introduces a new kernel-only test binary that purely relies on the kernel C header and the C++ standard library. This is intentionally done to show its capabilities without relying on other code inside the project. This may be relaxed to include some of the existing utilities, or even be merged into the existing test suite.\r\n\r\nThe complete docs for the API as well as some usage examples are hosted on [thecharlatan.ch/kernel-docs](https://thecharlatan.ch/kernel-docs/index.html). The docs are generated from the following repository (which also holds the examples): [github.com/TheCharlatan/kernel-docs](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/kernel-docs).\r\n\r\n#### How can I review this PR?\r\n\r\nScrutinize the commit messages, run the tests, write your own little applications using the library, let your favorite code sanitizer loose on it, hook it up to your fuzzing infrastructure, profile the difference between the existing bitcoin-chainstate and the bitcoin-chainstate introduced here, be nitty on the documentation, police the C interface, opine on your own API design philosophy.\r\n\r\nTo get a feeling for the API, read through the tests, or one of the examples.\r\n\r\nTo configure this PR for making the shared library and the bitcoin-chainstate and test_kernel utilities available:\r\n```\r\ncmake -B build -DBUILD_KERNEL_LIB=ON -DBUILD_UTIL_CHAINSTATE=ON\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce compiled the library is part of the build artifacts that can be installed with:\r\n```\r\ncmake --install build\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Why a C header (and not a C++ header)\r\n\r\n* Shipping a shared library with a C++ header is hard, because of name mangling and an unstable ABI.\r\n* Mature and well-supported tooling for integrating C exists for nearly every popular language.\r\n* C offers a reasonably stable ABI\r\n\r\nAlso see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30595#issuecomment-2285719575.\r\n\r\n#### What about versioning?\r\n\r\nThe header and library are still experimental and I would expect this to remain so for some time, so best not to worry about versioning yet.\r\n\r\n#### Potential future additions\r\n\r\nIn future, the C header could be expanded to support (some of these have been roughly implemented):\r\n\r\n* Handling transactions, block headers, coins cache, utxo set, meta data, and the mempool\r\n* Adapters for an abstract coins store\r\n* Adapters for an abstract block store\r\n* Adapters for an abstract block tree store\r\n* Allocators and buffers for more efficient memory usage\r\n* An \"[io-less](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/how-to-sans-io.html)\" interface\r\n* Hooks for an external mempool, or external policy rules\r\n\r\n#### Current drawbacks\r\n\r\n* For external applications to read the block index of an existing Bitcoin Core node, Bitcoin Core needs to shut down first, since leveldb does not support reading across multiple processes. Other than migrating away from leveldb, there does not seem to be a solution for this problem. Such a migration is implemented in #32427.\r\n* The fatal error handling through the notifications is awkward. This is partly improved through #29642.\r\n* Handling shared pointers in the interfaces is unfortunate. They make ownership and freeing of the resources fuzzy and poison the interfaces with additional types and complexity. However, they seem to be an artifact of the current code that interfaces with the validation engine. The validation engine itself does not seem to make extensive use of these shared pointers.\r\n* If multiple instances of the same type of objects are used, there is no mechanism for distinguishing the log messages produced by each of them. A potential solution is #30342.\r\n* The background leveldb compaction thread may not finish in time leading to a non-clean exit. There seems to be nothing we can do about this, outside of patching leveldb.",

It contains the following changes that are crucial for the embedding of asmap data which is added the following PR in the series (probably this will remain in #28792).\r\n\r\nThe changes are:\r\n- Modernizes and simplifies the asmap code by operating on `std::byte` instead of bits\r\n- Unifies asmap version calculation and naming (previously it was called version and checksum interchangeably)\r\n- Operate on a `span` rather than a vector in the asmap internal to prevent holding the asmap data in memory twice\r\n- Add more extensive documentation to the asmap implementation\r\n- Unify asmap casing in implemetation function names\r\n\r\nThe first three commits were already part of #28792, the others are new.\r\n\r\nThe documentation commit came out of feedback gathered at the latest CoreDev. The primary input for the documentation was the documentation that already existed in the Python implementation (`contrib/asmap/asmap.py`) but there are several other comments as well. Please note: I have also asked several LLMs to provide suggestions on how to explain pieces of the implementation and better demonstrate how the parts work together. I have copied bits and pieces that I liked but everything has been edited further by me and obviously all mistakes here are my own. ",

This meant the node would not discover its own local addresses if an explicit \"any\" bind was used.\r\n\r\nThis commit checks both `bind_on_any` and any bind addresses using `IsBindAny()` to ensure `Discover()` runs when binding to 0.0.0.0 or ::, even if specified explicitly.\r\n\r\nNote: This fix targets the 26.x branch.

      "body": "### Rationale\r\n\r\nThis PR improves code safety by removing a `const_cast` in `src/validation.cpp`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `setBlockIndexCandidates` stores mutable `CBlockIndex*`. However, validation logic (like `CVerifyDB`) often holds `const CBlockIndex*`. Previously, checking for existence in the set required casting away constness. While currently benign, this bypasses compiler safety checks and could mask accidental modifications in future refactors.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n1.  **Enable Heterogeneous Lookup:** Added `using is_transparent = void;` to `CBlockIndexWorkComparator` in `src/node/blockstorage.h`. This allows the `std::set` to natively accept `const CBlockIndex*` for lookup (utilizing C++14 heterogeneous lookup).\r\n2.  **Remove Cast:** Removed the now unnecessary `const_cast<CBlockIndex*>` in `src/validation.cpp`, allowing the compiler to strictly enforce const-correctness.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n- **Refactoring only:** No behavioral change.\r\n- **Verification:** `validation_tests` and `blockmanager_tests` pass.",

      "title": "kernel: use structured logging and simplify logging interface",
      "body": "tl;dr: kernel logging is cumbersome. This PR enables structured logging and a much simplified kernel logging interface. Closes #34062.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe `bitcoinkernel` library (#27587) [exposes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b26762bdcb941096ccc6f53c3fb5a7786ad735e7/src/kernel/bitcoinkernel.h#L698-L778) functionality to interface with the kernel logging. This includes registering callbacks for log statements, level/category filtering, string formatting options, and more.\r\n\r\nKernel logging has a few problems:\r\n- [callbacks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b26762bdcb941096ccc6f53c3fb5a7786ad735e7/src/kernel/bitcoinkernel.h#L304) operate on formatted strings, so users need to parse the string to get the timestamp, category, level, ... based on which options are set. This is cumbersome, brittle, and inefficient.\r\n- the [filtering interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b26762bdcb941096ccc6f53c3fb5a7786ad735e7/src/kernel/bitcoinkernel.h#L737) is not really intuitive, requiring users to call combinations of `btck_logging_set_level_category` and `btck_logging_enable_category` when they want to produce `debug` or `trace` logs. The level/category system makes sense for node, because it directly controls what gets written to disk and stdout, and there are quite a lot more categories producing logs. Kernel doesn't really need this - users control what happens to the logs, and can do any filtering/manipulation in the callback they provide.\r\n- the node logging infrastructure has quite a bit more functionality than is necessary for a library, including ratelimiting, log formatting, outputting, buffering, ... This introduces unnecessary code and interface complexity.\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n\r\nMost of the logic in `logging.h` is not necessary for `bitcoinkernel`, so we first separate it into `util/log.h` and `logging.h` (`common`), then upgrade the `bitcoinkernel` logging interface, and finally remove the `logging.cpp` dependency from kernel entirely.\r\n\r\n1. **Separate log generation**: Add a minimal `util::log::Dispatcher` that is used to generate logs, and forwards structured log entries to registered callbacks. No formatting, rate-limiting, or output handling - that's the consumer's responsibility. Dispatcher can be configured with a `filter` predicate (e.g. `WillLogCategoryLevel()` for `node`, or a simpler levels-based filter for `bitcoinkernel`) to avoid unnecessary string formatting and other overhead.\r\n2. **Register `BCLog::Logger` on Dispatcher**: Register a callback on the global Dispatcher to receive entries and handle node-specific concerns (formatting, rate-limiting, file output) without changing most of its logic.\r\n3. **Move logging macros to `util/log.h`**: Allows the entire codebase (including kernel code) to use the same macros without depending on `logging.h`.\r\n4. **Update bitcoinkernel C API**: Replace the string-based callback with `btck_LogEntry` containing full metadata. Remove `btck_LoggingOptions` and category enable/disable functions. Add `btck_logging_set_min_level()` for early filtering.\r\n5. Move **`logging.cpp` to `common`**: remove it as a kernel dependency entirely.\r\n\r\n## Appendix\r\n\r\n### `bitcoinkernel` C logging interface\r\n\r\n```c\r\nstruct btck_LogEntry {\r\n    const char* message;       //!< Log message\r\n    size_t message_len;        //!< Log message length\r\n    const char* file_name;     //!< Source file name\r\n    size_t file_name_len;      //!< Source file name length\r\n    const char* function_name; //!< Source function name\r\n    size_t function_name_len;  //!< Source function name length\r\n    const char* thread_name;   //!< Thread name\r\n    size_t thread_name_len;    //!< Thread name length\r\n    int64_t timestamp_ns;      //!< Timestamp in nanoseconds since epoch\r\n    uint32_t line;             //!< Source line number\r\n    btck_LogLevel level;       //!< Log level\r\n    btck_LogCategory category; //!< Log category\r\n};\r\n\r\ntypedef void (*btck_LogCallback)(void* user_data, const btck_LogEntry* entry);\r\n\r\nBITCOINKERNEL_API void btck_logging_set_min_level(btck_LogLevel level);\r\n\r\nBITCOINKERNEL_API btck_LoggingConnection* BITCOINKERNEL_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT btck_logging_connection_create(\r\n    btck_LogCallback log_callback,\r\n    void* user_data,\r\n    btck_DestroyCallback user_data_destroy_callback) BITCOINKERNEL_ARG_NONNULL(1);\r\n\r\nBITCOINKERNEL_API void btck_logging_connection_destroy(btck_LoggingConnection* logging_connection);\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

The mempool does accept transactions via RPC, or the wallet at the time, however these don't interact with the orphanage and the txdownloadman, because adding anything to those is guarded by IsInitialBlockDownload() checks as well.\r\n\r\nWe're usually latching ibd to false a few blocks before catching up to the tip, so this should also not significantly degrade the performance of the filter once fully caught up.",

      "body": "There is plenty of test code that exercises the code path for FRESH-but-not-DIRTY coins in CCoinsViewCache. However, we can see there is only one place in production code where we call `SetFresh` that is not preceded by `SetDirty`. This is in `CCoinsViewCache::FetchCoin` and we can see that this is called if the coin retrieved from `base->GetCoin` is spent. The `base` in this case can be another `CCoinsViewCache` or a `CCoinsViewDB`. In `CCoinsViewCache::GetCoin` we can see that we do not return spent coins, and in `CCoinsViewDB` we don't ever store spent coins so there are none to return.\r\n\r\nThus, we can safely remove this dead code, and now we can see that there are never any calls to `SetFresh` not preceded by `SetDirty`. This PR removes this dead code and replaces `SetFresh` by passing a `fresh` boolean flag to `SetDirty`. This simplifies the logic of `CCoinsViewCache` and lets us remove test cases checking for FRESH-but-not-DIRTY coins. It removes the possibility of FRESH-but-not-DIRTY coins being called from any code path, so we can eliminate this state entirely and reduce the cognitive load of having to consider it.\r\n\r\nThis is pulled out from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30673 to make the change simpler.",

      "body": "This PR adds test coverage for migrating legacy Bitcoin Core wallets from v0.14.3 (released in 2017) to the descriptor wallet format. The test validates that users can safely upgrade their wallets while preserving all funds, transaction history, and addresses.\r\n\r\nThis test was originally developed on top of #32977, as it was requested in reviews.\r\nHowever, since it also increases test coverage, it can be merged independently.\r\n\r\nThe test covers two wallet migration scenarios:\r\n\r\n* Non-HD Wallet Migration - Tests migration of non-HD wallets (created with `-usehd=0`)\r\n* Single Chain HD Wallet Migration - Tests migration of HD wallets from v0.14.3 (`VERSION_HD_BASE`)\r\n\r\nThe node v0.14.3 cannot be synced because it doesn't have the `syncwithvalidationinterfacequeue` RPC implemented (required by `test_framework.py`), so the solution is to copy the `block` folder to the modern node and start it with `-reindex-chainstate`. Because of this additional complexity, this testing is best managed in a separate file rather than in the existing migration test files.\r\n\r\n",

      "title": "CAT in Tapscript (BIP-347)",
      "body": "# CAT in Tapscript\r\n\r\nThis PR provides the necessary code to enable the opcode OP\\_CAT in Tapscript as specified in [BIP-347: OP\\_CAT in Tapscript](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0347.mediawiki) and [BIN-2024-0001](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/binana/blob/master/2024/BIN-2024-0001.md),\r\n\r\n**Important:** This PR *does not* include miner activation functionality. This means that merging this PR into bitcoin-core will not make OP\\_CAT functional in Bitcoin.\r\nIf this PR is merged it is *not* a signal of community consensus around activating CAT nor be read as a portent about the activation process or timeline.\r\nThe PR is not a stand-in for consensus around such decisions.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n\r\n- An implementation of the Tapscript opcode OP\\_CAT along with the flags `SCRIPT_VERIFY_OP_CAT` and `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_OP_CAT`.\r\n- Integration and unit tests which ensure that our CAT  implementation works as expected. This includes ensuring that CAT never uses more that 520 bytes of stack memory. A full description of what these tests cover is given below.\r\n- An improvement to `src/test/script_tests.cpp` JSON script format enabling the rapid creation of new Tapscript unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Activation on Bitcoin-inquisition (signet)\r\n\r\n[Bitcoin-inquisition PR 37](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/39) which contained our implementation of OP\\_CAT [was merged into bitcoin-inquisition (signet) on Apr 25 2024](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/39), released as [bitcoin-inquisition release 25.2 on Apr 26 2024.](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/releases/tag/v25.2-inq) and activated in bitcoin-inquisition Apr 30 2024. The bitcoin-inquisition PR was reviewed in the PR review club [(transcript of discussion)](https://bitcoincore.reviews/bitcoin-inquisition-39). Since Apr 30 2024 there have been many OP\\_CAT transactions created and spent on signet.\r\n\r\nThe code merged into bitcoin-inquisition differs from this PR, as we have removed the consensus logic which was used to activate it on signet.\r\n\r\n## OP\\_CAT Tapscript Implementation\r\n\r\nWe implement OP\\_CAT as a new Tapscript op code by redefining the opcode OP\\_SUCCESS126 (126 in decimal and 0x7e in hexadecimal). This is the same opcode value used by the original OP_CAT.\r\n\r\nWhen evaluated, the OP\\_CAT instruction:\r\n\r\n1. Pops the top two values off the stack,\r\n2. concatenates the popped values together in stack order,\r\n3. and then pushes the concatenated value on the top of the stack.\r\n\r\nOP\\_CAT fails if there are fewer than two values on the stack or if a concatenated value would have a combined size greater than the maximum script element size of 520 bytes.\r\n\r\nSee [BIP 347](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0347.mediawiki) for a deeper description.\r\n\r\n### Errors thrown\r\n\r\nIf evaluated OP\\_CAT can throw the following errors:\r\n\r\n- If at time of evaluation the stack has fewer than two elements we throw the error: `SCRIPT_ERR_INVALID_STACK_OPERATION`\r\n- If at time of evaluation the top two stack elements have a combined size greater than `MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE` (520 bytes) we throw the error: `SCRIPT_ERR_PUSH_SIZE`.\r\n\r\n### Script verification flags\r\n\r\nWhile this PR does not contain any miner signaling and activation logic and can not activate OP\\_CAT, it does contain two flags which future activation logic could set to control activation of OP\\_CAT.\r\n\r\n- `SCRIPT_VERIFY_OP_CAT` IF a bitcoin node has this set to true, then it treat OP\\_CAT enabled for Tapscript. That is, OP\\_SUCCESS126 will be redefining to OP\\_CAT in Tapscript. If this was set to true at the consensus level this would cause a soft fork.\r\n\r\n`SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_OP_CAT` When set to true, a node receiving any Tapscript transaction containing the opcode OP\\_CAT or OP\\_SUCCESS126 will reject the transaction throwing the error `SCRIPT_ERR_DISCOURAGE_OP_CAT` but not banning the node which relayed the transaction. This prevents nodes from relaying transactions with OP\\_CAT. This  is equivalent to the behavior of `SCRIPT_ERR_DISCOURAGE_OP_CAT = true` when `SCRIPT_VERIFY_OP_CAT = false` as OP\\_CAT is an OP\\_SUCCESS (OP\\_SUCCESS126).\r\n\r\nThis is how these two flags are intended to be used to ensure a smooth soft fork.\r\n\r\n| Stage | `SCRIPT_VERIFY OP_CAT` | `SCRIPT_VERIFY DISCOURAGE_OP_CAT` | Status |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| **1.Default** | False | True | This does not represent any change in behavior of the bitcoin-core node. |\r\n| **2.Upgrading** | True | True | OP\\_CAT is activating. |\r\n| **3.Upgraded** | True | False | It is clear that OP\\_CAT has been activated and the network has been upgraded. |\r\n\r\nThe flag `SCRIPT_ERR_DISCOURAGE_OP_CAT` provides a window of time for the network to fully activate, before nodes will relay or accept transactions containing OP\\_CAT in their mem pools.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis PR contains a suite of script tests to ensure that OP\\_CAT functions as expected. In the JSON script tests (`script_tests.json`), we test:\r\n\r\n- That if OP\\_CAT is not activated that there are no changes to bitcoin consensus.\r\n- That regardless of the activation or non-activation of OP\\_CAT in Tapscript, pre-Tapscript scripts, i.e. Bitcoin scripts, have no changes in behavior.\r\n- That OP\\_CAT when evaluated throws the expected error when there are less than two elements on the stack.\r\n- That OP\\_CAT when evaluated in a variety of circumstances and edge cases, successfully concatenates elements of the stack. This includes:\r\n  - multiple calls to OP\\_CAT in a row,\r\n  - evaluating OP\\_CAT inside of a IF conditional,\r\n  - evaluating OP\\_CAT on zero size stack elements, random and large stack elements,\r\n  - evaluating OP\\_CAT on values being moved to and from the alt stack,\r\n  - and checking that when evaluated OP\\_CAT concatenates the elements in the expected order.\r\n\r\nAll of these tests are designed to cover the happy path of OP\\_CAT, the various errors which OP\\_CAT can throw and all the corner cases between those two outcomes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we include three tests outside of the JSON script tests.\r\n\r\n- `cat_simple` and `cat_empty_stack` are designed to test OP\\_CAT outside of the JSON serialization regime. Ensure that we catch bugs that we might miss in the JSON script tests due to a bug introduced at the JSON serialization layer.\r\n- `cat_dup_test` enumerates all stack element sizes from 1 to 522 bytes and then enumerates up to 10 repetitions of `OP\\_DUP OP\\_CAT`. It then tests if the stack element would exceed 520 bytes and if so did OP\\_CAT throw the error `SCRIPT_ERR_PUSH_SIZE`. This allows us to be certain that OP\\_CAT will not introduce any `OP\\_DUP OP\\_CAT` memory exhaustion attacks.\r\n\r\n### Better Tapscript tests in JSON script tests\r\n\r\nWhile writing these JSON script tests (`script_tests.json`) we ran into the following problem. The JSON script tests are simple and easy to write for pre-Tapscript scripts, but adding or changing a Tapscript test requires substantial work per test.\r\nConsider the following pre-tapscript test:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\"'aa' 'bb'\", \"CAT 0x4c 0x02 0xaabb EQUAL\", \"P2SH,STRICTENC\", \"DISABLED_OPCODE\", \"CAT disabled\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas a Tapscript test for the same script (annotated with comments for better readability) would look like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n    [\r\n        \"aa\",\r\n        \"bb\",\r\n        \"7e4c02aabb87\", // output script\r\n        \"c0d6889cb081036e0faefa3a35157ad71086b123b2b144b649798b494c300a961d\", // control block\r\n        0.00000001\r\n    ],\r\n    \"\",\r\n    \"0x51 0x20 0x15048ed3a65748549c27b671936987093cf73a4c9cb18522a74fb9553060ca99\", // Tapscript output\r\n    \"P2SH,WITNESS,TAPROOT\",\r\n    \"OK\",\r\n    \"TAPSCRIPT CATs aa and bb together and checks if EQUAL to aabb\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nComputing the Tapscript output, such as `0x51 0x20 0x15048ed3a65748549c27b671936987093cf73a4c9cb18522a74fb9553060ca99`, requires writing custom code and running it for each test. The same is true for the Tapscript control block, such as `c0d6889cb081036e0faefa3a35157ad71086b123b2b144b649798b494c300a961d`. If a test is changed or updated new outputs and control blocks must be computed. The complexity of doing this is likely the reason that no one has added any Tapscript tests to JSON script tests until this PR.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we address this issue by adding the following improvements to JSON script tests:\r\n\r\n- Adding simple macros (`\"#SCRIPT#` and `#CONTROLBLOCK#`) that allow the script test parser to automatically generate and inject a valid Tapscript output and control block to be computed automatically from the JSON script.\r\n- Allowing Tapscript scripts to use the human readable strings like pre-script scripts by marking the location of the script in the witness stack using `#SCRIPT#`. This transforms the unreadable script `7e4c02aabb87` into `#SCRIPT# CAT 0x4c 0x02 0xaabb EQUAL`.\r\n\r\nThis results in the following JSON script test which is far easier to write and easier to read.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n    [\r\n        \"aa\",\r\n        \"bb\",\r\n        \"#SCRIPT# CAT\",\r\n        \"#CONTROLBLOCK#\",\r\n        0.00000001\r\n    ],\r\n    \"\",\r\n    \"0x51 0x20 #TAPROOTOUTPUT#\",\r\n    \"P2SH,WITNESS,TAPROOT,OP_CAT\",\r\n    \"OK\",\r\n    \"TAPSCRIPT Test of OP_CAT flag by calling CAT on two elements. TAPSCRIPT_OP_CAT flag is set so CAT is executed.\"\r\n],\r\n```\r\n  \r\n",

      "title": "wallet: fix unnamed legacy wallet migration failure",
      "body": "Minimal fix for #34128.\r\n\r\nThe issue occurs during the migration of a legacy unnamed wallet\r\n(the legacy \"default\" wallet). When the migration fails, the cleanup\r\nlogic is triggered to roll back the state, which involves erasing the\r\nnewly created descriptor wallets directories. Normally, this only\r\naffects the parent directories of named wallets, since they each\r\nreside in their own directories. However, because the unnamed\r\nwallet resides directly in the top-level `/wallets/` folder, this\r\nlogic accidentally deletes the main directory.\r\n\r\nThe fix ensures that only the wallet.dat file of the unnamed wallet\r\nis touched and restored, preserving the wallet in BDB format and\r\nleaving the main `/wallets/` directory intact.\r\n\r\n#### Story Line:\r\n#32273 fixed a different set of issues and, in doing so, uncovered\r\nthis one.\r\nBefore the mentioned PR, backups were stored in the same directory\r\nas the wallet.dat file. On a migration failure, the backup was then\r\ncopied to the top-level `/wallets/` directory. For the unnamed legacy\r\nwallet, the wallet directory is the `/wallets/` directory, so the source\r\nand destination paths were identical. As a result, we threw early in the\r\n`fs::copy_file` call ([here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/29.x/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L4572)) because the file already existed, as we\r\nwere trying to copy the file onto itself. This caused the cleanup logic\r\nto abort early on and never reach the removal line.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Testing Notes:\r\nCherry-pick the test commit on top of master and run it. You will\r\nsee the failure and realize the reason by reading the test code.",

      "title": "Rollback for dumptxoutset without invalidating blocks",
      "body": "This is an alternative approach to implement `dumptxoutset` with rollback that was discussed a few times. It does not rely on `invalidateblock` and `reconsiderblock` and instead creates a temporary copy of the coins DB, modifies this copy by rolling back as many blocks as necessary and then creating the dump from this temp copy DB. See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29553#issuecomment-1978480989, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32817#issuecomment-3012406102 and #29565 discussions.\r\n\r\nThe nice side-effects of this are that forks can not interfere with the rollback and network activity does not have to be suspended. But there are also some downsides when comparing to the current approach: this does require some additional disk space for the copied coins DB and performance is slower (master took 3m 17s vs 9m 16s in my last test with the code here, rolling back ~1500 blocks). However, there is also not much code being added here, network can stay active throughout and performance would stay constant with this approach while it would impact master if there were forks that needed to be invalidated as well (see #33444 for the alternative approach), so this could still be considered a good trade-off.",

      "body": "This makes sure the initial address self-announcement a node sends to a peer happends in a separate P2P message. This has benefits for both inbound and outbound connections:\r\n\r\nFor inbound connections from a peer to us, previously, we might send the self-announcement along with our response to a GETADDR request. However, the self-announcement might replace an address from the GETADDR response. This isn't clean.\r\n\r\nFor outbound connections from us to a peer, previously, it could have happend that we send the self-announcement along with other addresses. Since shortly after connection open, the peer might only have one rate-limiting token for us, and the addresses are shuffeld on arrival, it's possible that the self-announcement gets rate-limited. However, note that these rate-limitings seem to be rare in practice.\r\n\r\nThis is inspired by and based on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33699#issuecomment-3462287763.

      "title": "kernel: make logging struct-based",
      "body": "The `bitcoinkernel` library (#27587) [exposes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b26762bdcb941096ccc6f53c3fb5a7786ad735e7/src/kernel/bitcoinkernel.h#L698-L778) functionality to interface with kernel logging. This includes registering callbacks for log statements, level/category filtering, string formatting options, and more.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves kernel logging by making it struct-based instead of string-based. Rather than adding this functionality onto an already large `BCLog::Logger` class, the PR first separates log generation (i.e. producing the log message via `LogInfo(msg)`) from log consumption (i.e. formatting, ratelimiting, printing the message) by moving all log generation code to `util/log.h`. While not strictly necessary for adding struct-based logging, it better separates concerns and is a prerequisite for follow-up work in #34374 that completely removes `kernel`'s dependency on `logging.cpp`.\r\n\r\n**Approach:**\r\n\r\n1. **Separate log generation**: Add a minimal `util::log::Dispatcher` that is used to generate logs, and forwards struct-based log entries to registered callbacks. No formatting, rate-limiting, or output handling - that's the consumer's responsibility.\r\n \r\n1. **Register `BCLog::Logger` on Dispatcher**: Register a callback on the global Dispatcher to receive entries and handle node-specific concerns (formatting, rate-limiting, file output) without changing most of its logic. Route logging macros through this global dispatcher.\r\n \r\n1. **Update bitcoinkernel C API**: Replace the string-based callback with `btck_LogEntry` containing full metadata and remove `btck_LoggingOptions` and related functions.\r\n\r\nNote: with this change, `bitcoinkernel` logging callbacks are no longer routed through `BCLog::Logger`. This means that they are no longer buffered (i.e. log messages produced before a logging callback is registered) are dropped, and there is no longer a need for `btck_logging_disable`. In practice, this means users can no longer see the log message produced during the static [context initialization](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/01651324f4e540f6b96cff31e89752c3f9417293/src/kernel/context.cpp#L20).\r\n\r\nCarve-out of #34374 to narrow the focus while maintaining tangible benefits (i.e. having struct-based logging).\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "The issue is that `erase` sometimes doesn't succeed in removing the tip. We populate `setBlockIndexCandidates` in `LoadBlockIndex` with sequence id 1 and then later change it to 0 in `LoadChainTip`, which ends up corrupting the tree structure of the set. The tip was initially stored based on the sequence id being 1, so calling `erase` after the change to 0 might just return null.\n\nAfter we re-add the tip, it's now in `setBlockIndexCandidates` twice, but because there was a block race, that set ends up looking something like this:\n\n```bash\n2026-02-05T15:42:13Z DEBUG: Before erase/re-insert, candidates size=535, tip ptr=0x600000d17d20\n2026-02-05T15:42:13Z DEBUG: erase(tip) removed 0 elements\n2026-02-05T15:42:13Z DEBUG: After prune, candidates size=4 (should be 1)\n2026-02-05T15:42:13Z DEBUG: h=505 seqId=0 ptr=0x600000d17d20 hash=583a9332474464f8\n2026-02-05T15:42:13Z DEBUG: h=505 seqId=1 ptr=0x600000d149f0 hash=0f002c5df6f09f9b\n2026-02-05T15:42:13Z DEBUG: h=505 seqId=1 ptr=0x600000d07df0 hash=5ed3fc31e5ae9f6d\n2026-02-05T15:42:13Z DEBUG: h=505 seqId=0 ptr=0x600000d17d20 hash=583a9332474464f8\n```\nbecause the prune stops at the first instance of the tip. So now in `CheckBlockIndex` the assertion that a block that sorts worse than the tip is not in the set fails.\n\nThe simple fix is just to move the erase to before changing the sequence ids, but it's still undefined behavior to modify the sequence id while blocks are in `setBlockIndexCandidates`. I believe the proper fix is to move the population of that set from `LoadBlockIndex` to `LoadChainTip` after setting the sequence ids. This would also be better because the current behavior has the candidate set at some point holding the entire block tree, which isn't really what that set is for.\n\nThe refactor is unfortunately proving to be more difficult than expected because of the other snapshot chainstate that we maintain. I'm happy to just open the quick fix for v31.",

This is the problem reported https://discourse.cmake.org/t/install-rpath-use-link-path-not-working-when-cmake-exe-linker-flags-ldflags-is-set/1892.\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eb97250421d35f8c172d43b69965af6273025702/depends/funcs.mk#L230-L232\n\nIt's possible the latter issue no longer exists and we could drop the `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH` setting from depends. Or maybe depends should be setting `CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` alongside `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH`. Unclear if those changes would fix this issue though because the relinking step here seems to be happening in the bitcoin build, not the depends build. I also don't understand what exactly causes cmake to decide it needs a relinking step, or if a reiinking step is actually needed here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Seems like the interest in supporting GCC is pretty secondary:\n> Is there any way we can get a CI build that tests GCC support? Otherwise I'm sure it'll just bitrot again.\n\n> OK, seems fine to merge now but we can't really claim that GCC is \"supported\" until we have CI tests since it'll probably bitrot.\n\nWhen that PR lands, it looks like they will be supporting GCC 14.2 and later (relevant fix from `15.1` was backported).\n\nAssuming we are going to support / use capnp V2 at some point, it would be good if it did support GCC, if it doesn't, we'll have to bootstrap & use both Clang and GCC, for Linux builds in Guix, or patch capnp until it works with (our version of) GCC, or something else.\n\nhttps://capnproto.org/roadmap.html seems pretty outdated, as it still lists pre-1.x items, so it's not really clear when V2 is planned to happen.",

For example, the wallet test could poll the wallet lock state instead of waiting 3 full seconds.\n\nProposal: Replace with `wait_until()` pattern already used elsewhere in the codebase.

Could also just reduce the hardcoded values, but smart polling is more robust.\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nHappy to implement this if there's interest. The wait_until() pattern is already used throughout the test framework, so this would just be applying it more consistently.",

      "title": "BIP32: Maximal length of derivation paths and depth of extended keys",
      "body": "Hi folks,\nI have started to notice and report an overflow of the depth of extended keys (as described in BIP32) and some confusion regarding the depth came up. On one hand, the depth is, I'd say indirectly, limited to the range [0 , 255] due to the serialization into a [single byte](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#serialization-format). On the other hand, I don't see an inherent technical reason(s) that would prevent deriving even _lower_ keys (with depth 255+).\n\nThe list of libraries, where I see the depth overflowing is increasing:  https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/pull/1624, https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/pull/3693, https://github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip32/issues/27, https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitcoin/issues/1260, https://github.com/piotrnar/gocoin/issues/71,...\n\nIn bitcoin repository, the overflow is caught [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/639279e86a6edd6cb68e8cf077d14337bcd13959/src/key.cpp#L360) (and also [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/639279e86a6edd6cb68e8cf077d14337bcd13959/src/pubkey.cpp#L407)) and there is also a [test case](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/449e2eb7e40f7e14300af92bce8e70a9fde91e1b/src/test/bip32_tests.cpp#L187-L203) for it. But the [derivation paths](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/449e2eb7e40f7e14300af92bce8e70a9fde91e1b/src/util/bip32.cpp#L18) themselves aren't restricted in the size. Due to the variety of implementations and libraries APIs' for the derivation paths and key derivation (priv -> priv, priv -> pub, pub -> pub), there are also a few different ways how to possibly hit the overflow.\n\nKeys that overflow could be _hiding_ coins (as they would appear to live at different levels), but the valid parents are likely still identifiable via the fingerprints. (Possibly, in some edge-cases, overflown keys could be invalid in such a way that the coins would get locked.) I am not familiar with how the depth is used later on, e.g., after key deserialization, and if it could cause other issues.\n\nAre there any legitimate reasons to allow longer paths and keys with depth > 255? Or shall any such overflow be considered a bug? Not sure, if I can tag Pieter Wuille, to get his thoughts regarding the depth validity and if there is more to it.",

      "title": "[rfc] Disallow loading and creating wallets by paths",
      "body": "A discussion that has come up several times at the Localhost office over the past several weeks has been whether it makes sense to load wallets by paths. In particular, supporting wallets by path has been the source of a couple issues, and has also had some involvement in the recent wallet deletion issue.\n\nFor some background, the name of a wallet can always be interpreted as a path. If it is not an absolute path, then it is a path relative to the wallets directory, e.g. a wallet named `mywallet` is always located at `<walletsdir>/mywallet`. But when referring to wallets named by relative path, I mean wallets which actually include `/` in their name which turns the name into a path specifier, rather than a logical name that happens to map to a path relative to the walletsdir. Otherwise, the path is an absolute path. An important note is that with the exception of BDB files stored directly in the walletsdir, the file actually opened is always `<path>/wallet.dat`.\n\nFor absolute paths, this seems mostly ok, if just a bit odd. This has the potential to be problematic when mixing wallet names with filenames and paths. However, I don't recall any specific issues with absolute paths off the top of my head.\n\nOn the other hand, relative paths that include additional directories (e.g.` <walletdir>/<subdir>/mywallet` or `../<more path>/mywallet`) have been a major source of headaches in wallet filesystem code:\n- #32273 pointed out a flaw in how wallet names and paths were being combined in relative paths to produce nonsensical paths\n- The root issue in #31409 is searching subdirectories for additional wallets to have their name by relative path\n\nFurthermore, from a user perspective, relative path wallets are really weird in that the path is relative to the walletsdir, which itself is not always consistent relative to the datadir (excluding when set explicitly). Given that the actual location of the walletsdir is basically never surfaced to the user, I don't really see any situation where a user would want to name a wallet `../<path>`. I can see `<sub>/mywallet`, but that really doesn't need to be a path, and the wallet could actually be in a directory named `<sub>/mywallet` where the `/` is escaped so it doesn't become a path.\n\nI propose that we should remove support for wallets with by relative path, but retain support for wallets by absolute path.\n\nBut I'd like to get some feedback from contributors and users before moving forward with this.\n\n***\n\nThere has also been the suggestion that we should go all the way and just remove support for both relative and absolute paths. I push back on this a bit as I think absolute paths can still be useful, e.g. if a user has wallets both in the walletsdir and on external media, they could want to load wallets from both locations at the same time without needing to change the walletsdir by specifying wallets by absolute path. However, I am open to being convinced that remove absolute path support could be a good idea.",

Electrum has similar behavior.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/48174c0f287b19931ca110670610bd03a03eb914/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L725-L731\r\n\r\nWhen spending an unconfirmed UTXO, it can happen that we back-date the locktime of our transaction to a locktime before the locktime of the unconfirmed parent. In this case, the \"transaction signed earlier but only broadcast now\" is unrealistic I think (please correct me if you think there is a protocol where this makes sense). This is a fingerprint that we are a Bitcoin Core or Electrum wallet.\r\n\r\nrelated https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26526\r\nelectrum issue: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/8073",
