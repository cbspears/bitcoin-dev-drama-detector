      "body": "This PR forces full database compaction on coinstatsindex every 10,000 blocks. This does not seem to come with any considerable performance impact, though I did not test on many different systems.\r\n\r\nMotivation: Currently, coinstatsindex ends up using a lot of 55kb files if this is not the case. This is likely related to very fast writes occurring during sync but so far I could not pin down where exactly the difference in behavior is coming from. It seems to be a LevelDB internal thing though, since I can not make out any difference in configuration between coinstatsindex and the other indexes.\r\n\r\nThis was first reported here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30469#issuecomment-3235597424",

I think that at the size and usage pattern of the coinstatsindex we are not really facing any significant problems on a modern computer and system since the size of the data we are storing is very small relatively speaking for what LevelDB is capable of handling. But I think the impact is probably also non-zero and might increase over time as the blockchain grows. Very high-level rationale: there must be a reason LevelDB does these compactions usually.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell the best resource on this topic is this docs page: https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/leveldb/%2B/HEAD/doc/impl.md#timing From my understanding these small files are L0 files and having many of them means we potentially have overlapping keys among them, meaning we are wasting disk space, and \"This may significantly increase the cost of reads due to the overhead of merging more files together on every read.\" per the document.",

This is documented (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs/re-run-workflows-and-jobs):\r\n\r\n>  Re-run workflows [...] will also use the same GITHUB_SHA (commit SHA) and GITHUB_REF (git ref) of the original event that triggered the workflow run.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/actions/runs/17458152407/job/49579638898?pr=29641#step:9:914 compiles with IPC=ON, even though latest master is at ed2ff3c63d83e275b0785a695fa4db38870abf1a\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32989#issuecomment-3133536724 (example explained in comment)\r\n\r\nThis is problematic, because:\r\n\r\n* Unrelated CI failures and intermittent issues, which are fixed or worked around in latest master can not be cleaned by re-running the task. The author has to actively go out and (force-)push the branch, invalidating review.\r\n* It is odd to have a recent CI run, but it uses code and config from the past.\r\n* Detecting silent merge conflicts by re-running the CI task is impossible.\r\n\r\nFix all issues by checking out the latest merged state of the pull request. The behavior is unchanged for non-pull-request actions. This patch changes the \"re-run\" default behaviour. Forcing it to use the new state instead of running the old state again.\r\n",

And i don't think exponential backoff would be good here, either. If the user switches to a network with a PCP-supporting router, we want to use that as soon as possible.\n\nBut moving the noisy failure messages to a category makes sense, imo. If someone wants to debug PCP issues they can enable that category.",
