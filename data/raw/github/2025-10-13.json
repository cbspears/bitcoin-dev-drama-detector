      "body": "The gen-manpages.py script was missing critical build option checks,\r\ncausing incomplete man page generation. This commit adds comprehensive\r\nbuild option detection to ensure all available options are documented.\r\n\r\nChanges made:\r\n- Add missing USE_UPNP build option detection (core requirement from #17506)\r\n- Remove unused build options that were listed but not actually used\r\n- Add error handling for missing 'components' section in config.ini\r\n- Improve code structure with proper function organization\r\n\r\nThe script now prevents generation of incomplete man pages by \r\nall required build options and provides clear error messages when\r\ncomponents are missing. Users can use --skip-build-options-check to\r\nbypass this check if needed.\r\n\r\nFixes #17506",

For instance it was deemed worthwhile to bring back the utility around in `bitcoin-cli` (#19133). Not everyone uses the entire bitcoin core stack for developing their infrastructure (i.e. `bitcoin-cli`), so why not expose these useful utilities to everyone? 🤷‍♂️ . \n\n>The behavior is not because of any repeated access to the wallet but rather because a bunch of blocks are being produced which are relevant to the wallet.\n\nYes, so have the `generate` RPC send funds a to an address that are not relevant to the wallet, which avoids the performance issue. I'll be doing this to work around this performance regression, but it would be nice if bitcoin core just did this \"out of the box\", IMO.",

I think it's benign.\n\nWhat happens:\n- `CConnman` is started [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/64a7c7cbb975cb3c3f25a3f784779f32cd95ebaa/src/init.cpp#L2183).\n  - This initializes `semOutbound` [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/64a7c7cbb975cb3c3f25a3f784779f32cd95ebaa/src/net.cpp#L3361).\n- While `CConnman` is active, `m_reconnections` is added to in `DisconnectNodes` [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/64a7c7cbb975cb3c3f25a3f784779f32cd95ebaa/src/net.cpp#L1981).\n- `CConnman` is stopped [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/64a7c7cbb975cb3c3f25a3f784779f32cd95ebaa/src/init.cpp#L315)\n  - The call to `Stop` will call `StopNodes` which will reset `semOutbound` [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/64a7c7cbb975cb3c3f25a3f784779f32cd95ebaa/src/net.cpp#L3511).\n- `~CConnman` is invoked a few lines below [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/64a7c7cbb975cb3c3f25a3f784779f32cd95ebaa/src/init.cpp#L328).\n  - In addition to calling `Stop` a second time, it also destructs a possibly non-empty `m_reconnections` (a list of `ReconnectionInfo` which contains a [pointer to the memory](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/64a7c7cbb975cb3c3f25a3f784779f32cd95ebaa/src/net.h#L1690) that `semOutbound` also pointed to) by calling `clear()`. To destroy each element of `m_reconnections`, it looks like it accesses the `grant` field but that memory was already freed.\n\nI haven't been able to reproduce this reliably, it appears timing-dependent. I think this can be fixed by calling `WITH_LOCK(m_reconnections_mutex, m_reconnections.clear())` before [this line](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/64a7c7cbb975cb3c3f25a3f784779f32cd95ebaa/src/net.cpp#L3511).\n\nASAN output:\n```\n=================================================================\n==22244==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free on address 0x6020018ba9d0 at pc 0x000100837e58 bp 0x00016f826280 sp 0x00016f826278\nWRITE of size 8 at 0x6020018ba9d0 thread T0\n==22244==WARNING: Can't write to symbolizer at fd 5\n    #0 0x100837e54 in void std::__1::__destroy_at[abi:ne180100]<CConnman::ReconnectionInfo, 0>(CConnman::ReconnectionInfo*) construct_at.h:67\n    #1 0x100837754 in std::__1::__list_imp<CConnman::ReconnectionInfo, std::__1::allocator<CConnman::ReconnectionInfo>>::clear() list:635\n    #2 0x1008202b8 in CConnman::~CConnman() net.cpp:3526\n    #3 0x10075802c in Shutdown(node::NodeContext&) init.cpp:328\n    #4 0x1005decc0 in main bitcoind.cpp:292\n    #5 0x1937bab48  (<unknown module>)\n\n0x6020018ba9d0 is located 0 bytes inside of 8-byte region [0x6020018ba9d0,0x6020018ba9d8)\nfreed by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x1034ed2e4 in _ZdlPv+0x6c (libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib:arm64+0x612e4)\n    #1 0x10081fe9c in CConnman::StopNodes() net.cpp:3511\n    #2 0x100757ebc in Shutdown(node::NodeContext&) init.cpp:315\n    #3 0x1005decc0 in main bitcoind.cpp:292\n    #4 0x1937bab48  (<unknown module>)\n\npreviously allocated by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x1034ececc in _Znwm+0x6c (libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib:arm64+0x60ecc)\n    #1 0x10081c77c in CConnman::Start(CScheduler&, CConnman::Options const&) net.cpp:3361\n    #2 0x10077d364 in AppInitMain(node::NodeContext&, interfaces::BlockAndHeaderTipInfo*) init.cpp:2183\n    #3 0x1005debd0 in main bitcoind.cpp:288\n    #4 0x1937bab48  (<unknown module>)\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free construct_at.h:67 in void std::__1::__destroy_at[abi:ne180100]<CConnman::ReconnectionInfo, 0>(CConnman::ReconnectionInfo*)\nShadow bytes around the buggy address:\n  0x6020018ba700: fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fa\n  0x6020018ba780: fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fa\n  0x6020018ba800: fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x6020018ba880: fa fa 00 00 fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa 00 00\n  0x6020018ba900: fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fd\n=>0x6020018ba980: fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd fa fa[fd]fa fa fa fd fa\n  0x6020018baa00: fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fa\n  0x6020018baa80: fa fa fd fa fa fa fd fd fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x6020018bab00: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x6020018bab80: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x6020018bac00: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\nShadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):\n  Addressable:           00\n  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 \n  Heap left redzone:       fa\n  Freed heap region:       fd\n  Stack left redzone:      f1\n  Stack mid redzone:       f2\n  Stack right redzone:     f3\n  Stack after return:      f5\n  Stack use after scope:   f8\n  Global redzone:          f9\n  Global init order:       f6\n  Poisoned by user:        f7\n  Container overflow:      fc\n  Array cookie:            ac\n  Intra object redzone:    bb\n  ASan internal:           fe\n  Left alloca redzone:     ca\n  Right alloca redzone:    cb\n==22244==ABORTING\n```",
