      "body": "# Add Docker support with multi-arch build and user permissions handling\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces a Dockerfile and supporting scripts to enable containerized builds and deployment of Bitcoin Core, targeting multiple architectures (amd64, arm64, riscv64).\r\n\r\n## Key changes include:\r\n- Multi-stage Dockerfile to build Bitcoin Core from official releases, GitHub source, or local source with consistent environments.\r\n- User and group creation inside the container to avoid running bitcoind as root, with proper permissions set on data directories.\r\n- Entrypoint script to dynamically configure RPC bindings based on IPv4 or IPv6 protocol environment variable.\r\n- Inclusion of gosu to drop root privileges safely inside the container.\r\n- Docker Compose file for easy local development and testing setups.\r\n\r\nThis improves deployment reproducibility, security by avoiding root execution, and supports multiple CPU architectures for broader compatibility.\r\n\r\nNo changes to core Bitcoin functionality have been made. Tests remain passing for the built binaries.",

This is (ab)used by some protocols, e.g. [by Lightning to encode extra data](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/exploring-extended-relative-timelocks/1818/23), but is unsafe when used unintentionally: `older(65536)` is equivalent to `older(1)`.\r\n\r\nThis PR emits a warning when `importdescriptors` contains such a descriptor.\r\n\r\nThe first commit makes `SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME` flags reusable by other tests.\r\n\r\nThe main commit adds the `ForEachNode` helper to `miniscript.h` which is then used in the `MiniscriptDescriptor` constructor to check for `Fragment::OLDER` with unsafe values. These are stored in `m_warnings`, which the RPC code then collects via `Warnings()`.\r\n\r\nIt adds both a unit and functional test.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA previous version of this PR prevented the import, unless the user opted in with an `unsafe` flag.
