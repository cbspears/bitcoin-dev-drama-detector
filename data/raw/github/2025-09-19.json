It should be trivial to take the actions from this repo and call them from one of the nightly CI repos.

If nobody uses any BE systems (IBM Z, older SPARC, some powerpc) perhaps it's not even useful in that role though...\r\n\r\nI'd agree with having this run as a nightly (or even less frequent) job. Would also note that secp256k1 are already running an s390x task:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/de6af6ae3568461edc9967500d7a70beeb66a642/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L161-L164\r\n\r\n...so critical cryptography code is already being tested for endianness bugs that way.

For development/debugging that should even be easier than to rely on a remove short-lived server. It should also be easy to temporarily add the config to the CI to trigger it on demand, if needed, similar to *BSD stuff, like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33435#discussion_r2364674969.\r\n\r\nAgain, I am not against adding this.

      "body": "From https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2025-09-18.html#l-365\n\n```\n<fanquake> sjors: how are you planning to handle version in the multiprocess subtree going forward?\n<fanquake> *versioning\n<Sjors[m]1> fanquake: do you mean versioning of the interface or of the multiprocess dependency?\n<fanquake> I'm guessing release branches to match Core? Otherwise I'm wondering what the plan is if you need to land bugfixes from multiprocess that wont apply to release branches, due to api changes or similar\n<Sjors[m]1> For the latter we should probably tag whatever is in v30\n<fanquake> We also don't generally backport subtree updates, so this would also be new for multiprocess\n<sipa> if a subtree has a bugfix that matters, it does seem reasonable to backport it\n<fanquake> Sure, but that might have to be selective, rather than a full pull\n<sipa> yeah, makes sense\n<fanquake> so by default isn't a clean backport\n<fanquake> so just wondering what the plan is there, and if anything is going to be done to track things upstream in the multiproess repo\n<Sjors[m]1> Maybe ryanofsky has a specific plan. I would imagine indeed having a seperate branch to track minimal changes if anything needs to be backported to v30.1+\n<fanquake> Ok, can leave it up to you and him to figure out going forward\n```\n\nI think there are two questions here:\n\n1. Which libmultiprocess changes should be backported to bitcoin release branches?\n2. What steps should be used to backport the changes if any are backports?\n\nIMO the short term answer to (1) should be either *all* of the changes or *none* of them. At least for the next few weeks I don't think there will be any libmultiprocess changes that aren't either safe or desirable to backport, like bugfixes, documentation improvements, CI improvements, and error handling improvements. I think the only changes to avoid backporting might be PRs that add new features like #32387 (adding windows support) or https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/209 (turning on newer cmake features). If/when PRs like these are merged, it will make sense to create a libmultiprocess `v1` stable branch corresponding to the bitcoin v30 branch, and more stable branches going forward, as fanquake suggested in IRC.\n\nI'm less sure about answer to (2), especially if subtree updates have never been backported before. I guess two options are either backporting subtree update PR's like #33412 using the normal backport process, or submitting separate subtree update PRs directly to the bitcoin release branches? I'm not sure which of these might more desirable or work better with tooling.\n\n",

CI and doc improvements should be harmless to backport and if all other patches in the short term are bugfixes, it makes sense to backport them all.\n\nIn practise, I don't think it is possible to cherry-pick a subtree merge commit without \"flattening\"/destroying it, so when the subtree bump is created on master, it could make sense to base it before the branch-off point, so that the exact same commit ID can be merged into both branches. Otherwise, a new subtree merge commit would have to be created in the backport branch, but this should be fine as well.",

Right now it looks like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33322 was the last update merged before the [30.x](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/30.x) branch point and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33412 was more recently merged after, so it may be too late to use that strategy in this branch, but it would seem like a good thing to do in the future.",

          "body": "I think this issue can be closed and there's a pretty clear process for backporting changes now.\n\n- For the `30.x` branch, since changes to the `src/ipc/libmultiprocess` subtree have been made to `master` after the `30.x` branch point, we need to have separate PR's like #33519 to update the subtree in `30.x`.\n- For future releases (`31.x` and later) we could base new subtree updates on previous subtree updates instead of on newer master commits. This would allow a single subtree update PR to be backported to multiple branches using clean merges as suggested https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33439#issuecomment-3346073946.\n- By default it probably makes sense to backport either all libmultiprocess changes or none of them to release branches and avoid making things more complicated by cherry-picking. But since [stable branches](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/branches/all) were created in the libmultiprocess repo after this issue was opened, cherry-picking individual libmultiprocess changes to previous bitcoin releases would be possible to do now by backporting the changes to stable branches in the libmultiprocess repo and then using those branches in the bitcoin repo.\n",
