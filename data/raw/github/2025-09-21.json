          "body": "It's not the queue that's exponentially decaying, but the inv queue drain rate tracking the relay rate with an exponential decay? *shrug*\r\n\r\nThe previous PR, #33448, may be helpful for observing the behaviour of this PR in the wild. I use the following command occassionally:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | jq -j '.[] | (.inv_to_send, \" \", .last_inv_sequence, \" \", .connection_type, \" \", .id, \" \", .relaytxes, \" \", .synced_blocks, \" \", (.network|sub(\"not_publicly_routable\";\"onion\")), \" inv-rx:\", ((.bytesrecv_per_msg.inv//0)/1024|floor), \"kB inv-tx:\", ((.bytessent_per_msg.inv//0)/1024|floor), \"kB gd-rx:\", ((.bytesrecv_per_msg.getdata//0)/1024|floor), \"kB nf-tx:\", ((.bytessent_per_msg.notfound//0)/1024|floor), \"kB blktxn:\", ((.bytessent_per_msg.blocktxn//0)/1024|floor), \"kB minfee:\", (.minfeefilter*1e6|floor)/10, \"s/vb \", (.subver|gsub(\" |(^$)\"; \"_\")), \" \", .addr, \"\\n\")' | sort -rn | column -t\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the behaviour we would ideally like here is for peers' inv queues to be fairly constrained (peaking at 500-2000 eg; values closer to 20,000 or 50,000 are likely to cause observable performance problems). The inv queue is already constrained by the size of the mempool, so extreme cases will only be observable with large, non-empty mempools.\r\n\r\nBut equally we'd like peers' INV messages to be fairly stable in size; since the network can only confirm 7-15 txs/second, there's not much value in relaying more txs than that on an ongoing basis, as many of the txs will simply expire or be rbf'ed before being confirmed. So having a non-zero queue to smooth out the number of txs we relay per second is helpful -- even delaying relay by a short period may be enough time for that tx to be rbf'ed and never need relaying by most of the network (eg, when a public auction is occurring and people are submitting bids by rbf'ing their own bids or other bids, eg for airdrop mints and Babylon staking).\r\n\r\nI think for monitoring the latter, it might be good to add a per-peer map from txs-per-inv to number-of-invs and see how that behaves on mainnet over an extended period?",

I hadn't noticed this was a different formula to what (I thought) we were discussing earlier.\r\n\r\nI think our exponential-based inv timing implies that 1% of invs will be at least 23s after the previous inv, and the formula above will mean we immediately send 32% of our current queue at that point, which seems excessive to me?
