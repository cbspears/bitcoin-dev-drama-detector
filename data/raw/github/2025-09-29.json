      "title": "test: sock: Enable socket pair tests on Windows",
      "body": "Some `class Sock`  tests were previously disabled because Windows lacks [`socketpair(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html). This PR adds a `CreateSocketPair()` helper which creates a sender socket and receiver socket with a TCP connection, enabling these test cases for Windows.\r\n\r\nThis change is generally an improvement, but is also broken out of a [branch](github.com/davidgumberg/bitcoin/tree/2025-09-02-0xB10C-prefill-rebase) that does compact block prefilling up to the available bytes in the connection's current TCP window (see [delving post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stats-on-compact-block-reconstructions/1052/34)). \r\n\r\nCreating connected socket pairs is useful for added tests in that branch that validate querying the current TCP window state, and without this change those tests don't run on Windows.",

I also recall now that part of the reason I've done it this way is that some of the tests I'm adding in my branch depend on being able to create and connect the sockets separately, and making TCP sockets instead of UNIX sockets which can't be done with `socketpair()`. This is useful so that e.g. sockopt's can be set that matter for the connection handshake: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/132d41a220c8e99ecf4b0c60a144606d32dd28ae/src/test/sock_tests.cpp#L195-L210\r\n\r\nEven though it's probably a bad idea to make changes in the present to suit a future use case that might never come about, I think it is generally useful to be able to create and connect the sockets separately in `sock_tests.cpp` and to be able to create TCP sockets like the application does.",

      "body": "[BIP 331](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0331.mediawiki) implements receiver-initiated package relay, where receivers can request missing information about packages. However, this requires excessive round trips. If the sender knows that it is giving the receiver a transaction for which it doesn't have the ancestors, it should be able to just send a package (containing the transaction and the unknown ancestor(s)) instead. \r\n\r\nThis PR could potentially reduce some bandwidth, and could also reduce the number of transactions in the orphanage. However, if a node is sending packages that the receiver already knows about, this could increase significant bandwidth. As a result, this PR needs more testing. I did some initial testing between two nodes with `sendpackages` enabled, and it showed that no redundant packages were sent, which indicates that this may be a useful feature. \r\n\r\nThis PR implements the following:\r\n- signaling support for `sendpackages` and the corresponding negotiation logic\r\n- a node will send a `pkgtxns` message to the receiver node if the ancestor of a transaction that has been requested is not in the receiver node's `m_tx_inventory_known_filter`\r\n- nodes can process `pkgtxns` messages\r\n- the maximum number of transactions that can be sent through sender-initialized package relay has been set to 2, although this can be changed in the future\r\n- adds logging, functional tests, and fuzzing (for `ReceivedPackage`)\r\n\r\nThank you to glozow for her help with this PR!

      "body": " When a node is connected to multiple networks (e.g., clearnet and Tor), it keeps separate ADDR response caches for each network. These are refreshed about once per day (randomized between 21 and 27 hours). See →[ https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net.cpp#L3519](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net.cpp#L3519)\r\nThis is an example of a dual-homed node’s addrman response, with separate caches:\r\n\r\n_IPv4 response:_\r\n```\r\n{102.130.242.11:8333 : 1741100851}\r\n{119.17.151.161:8333 : 1739825443}\r\n{ubeirqalc4vj54baszpatvctpohn62hzj7vfnbncy6upa6vywvgewrad.onion:8333 : 1739825443}\r\n\r\n```\r\n_Tor response:_\r\n```\r\n{102.130.242.11:8333 : 1741100851}\r\n{94.23.167.176:8333 : 1740895525}\r\n{ubeirqalc4vj54baszpatvctpohn62hzj7vfnbncy6upa6vywvgewrad.onion:8333 : 1739825443}\r\n\r\n```\r\nCurrently, there's a fingerprinting attack that exploits responses to GETADDR messages. An attacker can collect responses from supposedly different nodes and compare the timestamps. By looking at overlaps in responses, they can correlate Tor and clearnet identities — effectively linking them back to the same node.\r\nMore details on this attack here:[ https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/fingerprinting-nodes-via-addr-requests/1786](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/fingerprinting-nodes-via-addr-requests/1786)\r\n\r\nThis PR mitigates the attack by setting the timestamps in different caches to a fixed value in the past (10.5 ± 2.5 days), preventing correlation through timestamps.\r\nAfter the change, timestamps in each cache are now uniform, but differ between caches:\r\n\r\n_IPv4 response:_\r\n```\r\n{102.130.242.11:8333 : 1757964675}\r\n{119.17.151.161:8333 : 1757964675}\r\n{ubeirqalc4vj54baszpatvctpohn62hzj7vfnbncy6upa6vywvgewrad.onion:8333 : 1757964675}\r\n\r\n```\r\n_Tor response:_\r\n```\r\n{102.130.242.11:8333 : 1757878277}\r\n{119.17.151.161:8333 : 1757878277}\r\n{ubeirqalc4vj54baszpatvctpohn62hzj7vfnbncy6upa6vywvgewrad.onion:8333 : 1757878277}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe initially considered setting the timestamps to 0, since they would eventually be updated and saved. However, this isn’t compatible with btcd (see details here → https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/issues/2411 ). \r\nThis is still a work in progress — we’re continuing to test and are open to trying other solutions as well.\r\n\r\nThis is joint work with @danielabrozzoni",

There is a chaining effect, because the receiving peer will also relay it longer when it answers `GetAddr` requests itself, and so on. If this would happen frequently enough, the addr of the node that has left the network would always stay in the 10-30 day range and never cease to be relayed, and we'd be stuck with it forever - which would be problematic, because with enough time and node turnover, everyone's addrman would get \"full\" and there would be no more room for actual new nodes. \r\n\r\nThanks, this is insightful and likely to happen. I was initially thinking the other checks( `m_last_success `) might still be useful to mark zombie addresses as terrible.\r\n\r\nBut it’s unlikely that there would be enough attempted connections before the address is sent again.\r\n\r\n>The crucial question is if GetAddr interactions happen frequently enough for this to be an important effect.\r\n\r\nI don't have data on this yet - will grep and update soon",

          "body": "Thank you Martin, I agree that the current solution has this issue.\r\n\r\nOur other approach would have run into the same problem. We had considered setting all timestamps to zero, but we didn’t implement it because we’re not sure if it’s compatible with btcd, as mentioned in the PR description. This approach has the same problem as the current one:\r\n- Suppose we have an address in our addrman with a timestamp of 29 days ago, and the corresponding node has already left the network\r\n- We send the address in a getaddr response with the timestamp set to 0\r\n- The receiving node interprets that as “5 days ago”\r\n\r\nSo it ends up having the same problem: the address looks newer than it actually is, and it sticks around longer than it should, potentially forever.\r\n\r\nI’ve been thinking about an alternative solution, though I’m not sure if it makes sense. Perhaps an approach similar to the current one, but range-based, could work. Instead of setting every timestamp to 10 +- 2 days ago, we could adjust it based on how old the original timestamp is.\r\n\r\nAs a rough idea (numbers are just placeholders for now), we could generate three random reference timestamps once: one around 25+-2 days ago, one around 15+-2 days ago, and one around 5+-2 days ago; then assign each address to one of these depending on how old its original timestamp is:\r\n\r\n- If older than 25 days → use the 25-day reference\r\n- If older than 15 days → use the 15-day reference\r\n- Otherwise → use the 5-day reference\r\n\r\nThe exact numbers would need more thought. The fingerprinting issue would still exist: if two identities correspond to the same node, they would share the same initial timestamp and end up in the same range. Still, if we choose reasonable values, a large number of nodes might end up sending approximately the same timestamps.\r\n",

So it should be a separate pull request. Generally, bumping the sdk/xcode in depends is a lengthy/tedious process, so it should be done only when needed. My recommendation would be to bump it to 26.x within the next year, or to 27.x in one year.\r\n\r\nWhereas, this pull request is about increasing the min macos version to exclude the EOL macos version(s). This also allows to bump the xcode when self-compiling, e.g. in CI.\r\n\r\n> Note that latest `AppleClang` doesn't play well with latest `Clang` regarding fuzzing: [#32084 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32084#issuecomment-3361478681)\r\n\r\nThx, but I don't see how this is related to this pull?",

You'll have to carry a patch to revert the `src/test/fuzz/fuzz.cpp` changes (or skip compiling it), but that is trivial for you as a developer. (It may also be possible to use the clang package from brew or nix to compile, but that isn't supported or documented IIRC)\r\n\r\nThe goal here is to drop support for an insecure base operating system, so that users are not exposing themselves to unfixed security vulnerabilities on an internet-connected machine.\r\n\r\nNot sure what should be done differently here exactly to have a net benefit, but there are still 6 months until this even hits a release, so if there is something I am missing, there is plenty of time to re-visit.",

I can't find an official statement by Apple themselves that this version of macOS is unsupported, that seems to be an interpretation by others. It seems to be an extrapolation based on their _hardware_ support.\r\n\r\nThere are more recent security updates for other versions of macOS, but it could simply be that these issues don't impact 13. If on the other hand we know those bugs do apply to macOS 13, then that's a clear sign they _actually_ stopped maintaining it.",

Also, you can still run a 30.x node until the release of 33.0 (https://bitcoincore.org/en/lifecycle/), which is 1.5 years. Also, you can compile and run any version yourself at your own risk (not using xcode).\r\n\r\nThough, I am happy to review a pull request with the improvements you have in mind, if there are some.",
