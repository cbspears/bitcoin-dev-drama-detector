Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

      "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nHello,\n\nI would like to open a feature request or initiate a discussion around the possibility of reducing the overall energy consumption of the Bitcoin network.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has proven its resilience and decentralization through proof-of-work (PoW), the current energy requirements to secure the network are significant. This has raised growing concerns regarding its environmental impact, especially in the context of global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nKey Points:\n\nHigh Energy Demand: The Bitcoin network consumes more energy annually than some entire countries. This energy usage is mostly due to the PoW mining mechanism.\n\nEnvironmental Concerns: A large portion of mining operations still rely on fossil fuels, increasing the carbon footprint of the network.\n\nPublic Image and Adoption: Bitcoin's environmental footprint is often cited as a barrier to wider adoption and public acceptance, particularly among environmentally-conscious users, regulators, and institutions.\n\nLong-Term Sustainability: Exploring ways to make the network more energy-efficient could help ensure its viability in an increasingly carbon-regulated global economy.\n\n\nPossible Directions:\n\nResearch on protocol-level optimizations that reduce energy intensity without compromising decentralization or security.\n\nEncourage community dialogue about the future of PoW and the possibility of alternative consensus models or enhancements to make mining more sustainable.\n\nIncentivize greener mining practices or provide protocol-level support for low-carbon energy sources.\n\n\nThis is not a trivial issue, and any change to Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism must be approached with extreme care. However, opening the conversation and exploring possible paths toward reducing the network's energy demand would be a meaningful step for Bitcoin's future.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nAlexander\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nHello,\n\nI would like to suggest a feature or improvement that could significantly contribute to the adoption of Bitcoin as a common payment method, especially in physical stores.\n\nCurrently, transaction confirmation times can be too slow for real-time, in-person payments. This delay is a major obstacle to using Bitcoin as a day-to-day currency for retail purchases.\n\nProposal:\nExplore protocol-level optimizations or layer 1 improvements that would allow faster finality (or secure pre-confirmation mechanisms) suitable for small-value transactions in physical retail environments.\n\nPotential Benefits:\n\nEncourage wider adoption of Bitcoin in brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nImprove user experience for consumers and merchants.\n\nPosition Bitcoin as a practical digital currency, not just a store of value.\n\n\nThis request is not about replacing existing solutions like Lightning Network, but about exploring whether native Bitcoin transactions could be optimized to support such use cases more directly.\n\nThank you for considering this idea.\nAlexander \n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
