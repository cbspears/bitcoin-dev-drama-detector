The stack is previously validated to have least *i* elements (where *i* is number of pubkeys + number of signatures + 3), and then *i* - 1 elements are popped off the stack, leaving at least one element still in.\r\n\r\nThe redundant check was added in #3843 (commit 6380180821917c22ecfd89128ee60aae6f4cac33). There it's easy to see why it's redundant – it's inserted into a code path where another `popstack` would previously follow.\r\n\r\nNote the missing code coverage: https://maflcko.github.io/b-c-cov/total.coverage/src/script/interpreter.cpp.gcov.html#L1200",

So hopefully the situation is going to improve in future.\n\n\"Wait for 1.5.0\" SGTM, too.\n\nIf it isn't re-added i think it makes sense to remove the mention of the package from the docs completely, as most people are bound to run the newest debian release. The wording of \"various releases\" is a bit vague, more people are likely going to run into this.\n\nSo let's keep this issue open until it's resolved one way or another.",
