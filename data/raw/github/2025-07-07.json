As mentioned there, this is a naive implementation that would need to be optimized to have good performance, but it does show an end-to-end demo of how tracing could work using IPC.\r\n\r\nThe can be tested by building with `-DENABLE_IPC=ON` and running:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbuild/bin/bitcoin-node -regtest -ipcbind=unix  # Start node listening on IPC socket\r\nbuild/bin/bitcoin-trace -regtest -debug        # Run bitcoin-trace and connect to socket\r\nbuild/bin/bitcoin-cli -regtest -generate       # Create a block to generate sample traces\r\n```",

          "body": "Notes on current implementation of this:\r\n\r\n- The third commit f880817d54d9558938c697a37d0ef9acd4f34cf4 would be a lot simpler if it added a `Traces* g_traces` or similar global variable, which would be a reasonable thing to do. Initially, I wanted to avoid globals because they are hard to get rid of, and avoiding them could have benefits like being able to attach different tracers to different `CCoinsViewCache` instances, but this may not be worth extra complexity.\r\n- In the main commit 8e09fbe805fe77838363b7563d1dd0f2c934c1db, the duplication between [src/interfaces/tracing.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8e09fbe805fe77838363b7563d1dd0f2c934c1db/src/interfaces/tracing.h#L18-L40) and [src/ipc/capnp/tracing.capnp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8e09fbe805fe77838363b7563d1dd0f2c934c1db/src/ipc/capnp/tracing.capnp#L17-L34)  isn't very nice. Maybe some code generation could be done to generate one file from the other. This would be difficult to do for general IPC calls but might be easier for simple tracing definitions.\r\n- In the main commit 8e09fbe805fe77838363b7563d1dd0f2c934c1db, I made the [`coins.cpp` traces](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8e09fbe805fe77838363b7563d1dd0f2c934c1db/src/coins.cpp#L112-L117) verbose and explicit for clarity, but a real implementation should replace all of that tracing code with single `Trace()` calls like ` Trace<&UtxoCache::add>(UtxoInfo{outpoint.hash, ...})` which would reduce verbosity, and could be optimized to avoid locking and blocking for efficiency.",

Maybe @murchandamus has some thoughts on that.\r\n\r\nBeen pondering this a bit today. \r\n\r\n- In the first pass, we will always try to fund transactions only with confirmed UTXOs. If we are just requesting a new TRUC transaction, it will always get funded by confirmed UTXOs if we have sufficient confirmed funds.\r\n- If we are deliberately creating a child transaction, it’s probably because we want to CPFP an existing TRUC transaction and that already restricts the unconfirmed UTXOs to be created by the specific parent transaction. In that case, only other outputs from the same transactions are other eligible unconfirmed inputs.\r\n- This leaves only the case in which we are creating a TRUC transaction, but we do not have sufficient confirmed funds to pay for it. In that case, we can use one or several unconfirmed UTXOs from a single transaction in addition to any number of confirmed UTXOs.\r\n\r\nWe do have the `nDepth` member on `COutput`, so if we have several unconfirmed single outputs from transactions, we could keep track of whether we have selected an unconfirmed UTXO. Whenever we were to add a second unconfirmed UTXO, we could keep it or replace it with new one, depending on which has the greater effective value instead of adding it. Perhaps, just in case of creating TRUC transactions, we would create a new type of `OutputGroups` based on common parent transaction instead of common output script in that context. Because we can only use one `OutputGroup` that contains unconfirmed UTXOs, we could generate all subsets of a transaction’s outputs as separate OutputGroups, and thereby have those unconfirmed UTXOs appear multiple times in different configurations. We could only use that approach if there is a small number (<10?) of outputs to ourselves on the transaction as power sets grow exponentially. Either way, it  might be easier to have a dedicated algorithm for TRUC child transactions, that tracks the two pots separately, but all of that seems very complicated.\r\n\r\nGiven that it should be fairly uncommon to have all of your funds in flight and the complexity of alternatives, using the largest UTXO or group of UTXOs feels viable to me, although it could be improved in the future.",

      "title": "wallet: Prepare for future upgrades by recording versions of last client to open and decrypt",
      "body": "When a wallet is automatically upgraded, we always do so in a way that allows the user to load their wallet in an older version. When the user loads their wallet into an upgraded version again, the wallet may not perform the automatic upgrade and end up with upgraded and non-upgraded material in the wallet.\r\n\r\nIf we write some information about the last client to open the wallet, we would be able to detect these upgrade-downgrade-upgrade situations and perform another upgrade if so. However, in order for this to work, we need to have implemented writing such information into versions prior to the ones which introduce new automatic upgrades.\r\n\r\nWe are already writing the CLIENT_VERSION into all wallets in a \"version\" record, although this record is not updated in the same way across all previous versions. Since v24.0, we are always updating the record when the client version differs, but prior to that, the record would only be updated when the client version is newer. Even so, we can use this record to store the last client version.\r\n\r\nThe first commit decouples the written client version from the node version. This aids in development of new features. The version is entirely decoupled from previous versions by requiring all versions to have bit 30 set, and the initial version being `0 | (1 << 30)`. The versions just need to be at least 299900, and forcing bit 30 to be set was an easy way to achieve this.\r\n\r\nHowever, using version numbers is not as flexible as feature flags, so the second commit introduces the concept of Wallet Client Features. These flags are distinct from the existing Wallet Feature Flags since they are conceptually different. These are written in a separate record, and the wallet client version is incremented to `(1 << 0) | (1 << 30)`.\r\n\r\nLastly, since some upgrades may need private keys and can only occur after the wallet is decrypted, the third commit also adds a last decrypted features flags record to record the features of the last client to decrypt the wallet.\r\n\r\nThe result is that we will now be able to detect a downgrade down to v24.0 and be able to implement in parallel multiple features that require automatic upgrades.",

          "body": "Concept ACK. It shouldn't hurt to add more metadata to help detect when there might be a mix of old data in a newer format and new data in an older format in the same wallet.\r\n\r\nConceptually, I think we could always detect these cases by just scanning the entire wallet for data that needs to be upgraded on loading. But having this extra metadata is nice because it can avoid slowing down wallet loading by avoiding unnecessary upgrade rescans.\r\n\r\nOn the approach in e94ef51837daa5ec9552eb14e8ccc38d1b82b65b, I think it is ok, but would suggest some ways it might be improved:\r\n\r\n- I agree with Marco's [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32895#issuecomment-3048078577) that it would be great to move away from CLIENT_VERSION and use something independent of the node version.\r\n  - A downside of this suggestion is that the PR might not be able to reuse the existing VERSION field and might need to introduce 2 new fields instead of 1. I think the tradeoff could be worth it though.\r\n- It would be nice to avoid version numbers altogether and use feature flags instead, defining new feature flags when new data fields are introduced, and writing supported feature flags to LAST_OPENED_FEATURES & LAST_DECRYPTED_FEATURES fields on wallet loading.\r\n  - This would not require introducing a new data type since we already have a [WalletFlags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/927055e42afbfd998b5d85108e9c5fe7c6ffb7aa/src/wallet/walletutil.h#L36-L78) enum. New internal and external features could just be new (nonmandatory) `WalletFlags` values.\r\n  - IMO, flags are better than version numbers because they decouple code that implements new features from the merge and release process. They also make code more readable and maintainable because checks like `if (last_opened_supported_specific_feature_x)` are more obvious than `if (last_opened_version > some_version_number_with_collection_of_features)`\r\n- I assume we don't care about detecting upgrades & downgrades to versions before v24.0 which wouldn't overwrite the `VERSION` field on opening. But if we did, it'd be possible to detect this by writing last_opened and last_decrypted metadata to a file alongside the wallet database instead of inside the wallet database, and touching the file whenever the database is flushed. This way, if the database file modification time was greater than metadata file modification time, you could infer that the database had been loaded by an older version in the meantime and needs to be upgraded. Wouldn't recommend this approach because it is more complicated, but wanted to mention it as an alternative to introducing new database fields.",

The detection only works because of older versions overwriting the field with their CLIENT_VERSION. Introducing a new field now means that we cannot detect when an upgraded wallet was opened in any version older than v30.0 (assuming this is merged for the next release). The timeline would be too soon for any newly introduced features in say v31.0 or v32.0 (and I've got a few things in mind already that would utilize this). I'm already not particularly thrilled by the fact that the current implementation can only detect down to 24.0 as I expect that users doing upgrade-downgrade-upgrade with even older versions is commonplace.\r\n\r\n> Conceptually, I think we could always detect these cases by just scanning the entire wallet for data that needs to be upgraded on loading.\r\n\r\nI don't think that is actually viable as it would largely end up performing the upgrade on all loads regardless of whether the upgrade has already been done.",

The issue with using a brute solution I had was a) brute force is slow b) only works on a limited pool size of say 20 UTXOs (see a).  Instead of using brute force, I adopted a strategy where I generate two random UTXO sets.  Then, build a target from one of the two sets.  Finally merge the two sets and randomize.  Therefore there is for sure  a solution (unless iteration limit is hit) and the assertion asserts that BnB will find the solution (or that it doesn't due to some error condition like iteration limit reached).  I'm curious what you think of the pros and cons of your brute force strategy vs seeding a random solution and how it works with larger UTXO sets.\r\n",

Leaving once again the power of the whole/conjunct (democracy) at the mercy of the power of a few (oligarchy).\n\nNow that the efficiency of Bitcoin has been accepted even by institutions, maybe it's time to stop pandering those institutional whales, by creating an institution-proof Bitcoin replica, exclusively for physical persons. This could be a way to decentralize money in a second phase.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAs long as only humans are able to step inside this money platform, and institutions can be kept away, even   through false human agents, this could work also as a worldwide equity platform.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\nIf the proof method chosen is NIN's, for the citizens of countries without any trustful NIN system, a solution could be created in collaboration with other Bitcoin cycle agents (miners, nodes, etc).\n\nBiometrics, genome or blood could be an alternative to NIN's, but would add a huge layer of complexity.\n\nI would disagree with any solution that involves invasive technology.\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nI completely understand this would drastically remove the \"anonymity\" from Bitcoin, but it could be also a good thing for addressing iniquity and corruption (at least inside this blockchain).",
