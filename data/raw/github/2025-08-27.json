However, this may not be the case when the test is modified to use more ports. In this case, the tests may fail intermittently and the failure is hard to debug.\r\n\r\nFix this confusion, by calling `p2p_port` each time. This ensures the required `assert n <= MAX_NODES` is checked each time.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33250",
