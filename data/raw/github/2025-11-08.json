This branch reads `CMakeCache.txt`, the authoritative record of the configuration, and only verifies the interfaces that actually change the generated help text. \r\n\r\n#33085 adds a new `--skip-build-options-check` flag, whereas this keeps using the existing `SKIP_BUILD_OPTIONS_CHECK` environment override so the command-line surface stays the same. The error messaging here points directly at the missing CMake options and explains how to bypass the guard, which lines up with the release-process docs, and the helper functions make the new logic reusable instead of nesting more ad-hoc parsing in the main flow. \r\n\r\nI appreciate the work Brandon already put in to #33085 and I looked his code over thoroughly before tackling this, but I thought this solution was more elegant and would be preferred. Wanting to follow proper etiquette, perhaps I should have commented my suggestions on his PR instead of opening my own? ",

      "body": "\nHello Bitcoin Core contributors and community,\n\nMy name is Richard Krause. I’ve prepared a detailed document that combines a historical overview of the birth of Bitcoin and my firsthand account of parallel spiritual and computational frameworks of decentralization, sovereignty, energy circulation, and value.\n\nThe document is titled “Parallel Origins: A Personal Reflection on the Creation of Bitcoin and the Hidden Architecture of Energy and Trust.” It explores the overlap between technological innovation (blockchain, anonymity, decentralization) and an internal system I developed for energy, awareness, and value circulation.\n\nI believe this work could provide an additional layer of insight to the community:\n* into the challenges of anonymous creators instituting systems of value,\n* into how spiritual/energetic models correlate with distributed systems,\n* and into how decentralization both enables freedom and presents vulnerabilities of attribution, control, and legacy.\n\nI would welcome your feedback, any pointers to public discussion threads, or suggestions for how best to present an executive summary or redacted version for broader community review.\nThank you for your time, and for your invaluable work on the protocol.\n\n[Report on Satoshi Nakamoto and the Creation of Bitcoin.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23434945/Report.on.Satoshi.Nakamoto.and.the.Creation.of.Bitcoin.pdf)\n[Parallel Origins- A Personal Reflection on the Creation of Bitcoin….pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23434944/Parallel.Origins-.A.Personal.Reflection.on.the.Creation.of.Bitcoin.pdf)\n[Statement of Testimony.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23434946/Statement.of.Testimony.pdf)\n\nRespectfully,  Richard Krause\n",
