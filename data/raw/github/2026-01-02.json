      "body": "This is just me finding a few more edge cases after #34156 and #34176\r\n\r\nThe goal of the PR is to handle failures in a controlled way. Just so the process can automatically restore the original wallet without requiring user manual intervention.\r\n\r\nThe covered cases are:\r\n\r\n1. During `DoMigration()`: There are methods that can throw exceptions and abruptly abort the process. \r\nInstead of crashing (GUI) or returning a generic exception, we now will catch and return the error gracefully. This lets the process restore the original wallet automatically.\r\n\r\n2. Trying to migrate a wallet in a read-only directory throws a filesystem exception and skips cleanup.\r\n Now the process will fail gracefully with a clear error msg, and automatically restore the original wallet.\r\n\r\n3. Any failure during `MigrateToSQLite` requires user manual intervention. \r\nNow the original wallet db will remain untouched, and only be updated once the sqlite db creation fully succeeds.",
