      "title": "[WIP] mining: Quantum Computing Resistent Address, PQC - QNot address",
      "body": "## The problem:\r\nQuantum computing can, in the future, breaks the ECDSA algorithm used by Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n## Already proposed solution:\r\nHybrid signatures with the current signature algorithm plus a new computer-resistant algorithm. This solution has a serious problem where to a quantum computer breaks the UTXO and hack the blockchain its just necessary to know the public key used in the transaction. Right now, everybody shares its public key, so this is not solve the problem. \r\n\r\n## My proposal solution:\r\nWe had SegWit address type, then Taproot. Now I propose to create a new type of address called QNot. This address just use PQC algorithms.\r\nI choose as PQC algorithm the CRYSTALS-Dilithium.\r\nEvery bitcoin migrated to this new QNot addresses will be quantum resistant.\r\n\r\n## Benefits:\r\nThe decision to go to an address PQC keeps with the users of the network.\r\nWe don't change all already stabled addresses.\r\nWe don't increase the needed resources to running a bitcoin node because we just implement PQC algorithms for new addresses with interest on it.\r\n\r\n## Trade-offs:\r\nThe resources needed for running a bitcoin node or mining bitcoin is increased as many as people migrate to the new QNot addresses.\r\n",
