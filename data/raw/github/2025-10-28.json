What if it overflows u64? How do you want to detect that?\r\n\r\nWould you agree that, if the calculation is fixed to detect overflow before the cause then using `size_t` would not be a problem at all?",

However, in practise (using real-world sizes), it can be assumed with some confidence to not happen.\r\n\r\nI think you are right that ideally CheckedMul (https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.u64.html#method.checked_mul) is moved to our `src/util/overflow.h` and all places that have a real risk of overflowing are changed to use this helper.\r\n\r\nHowever, thinking about review and maintenance going forward, I am not convinced this is the right approach. It is not trivial to enumerate all places where overflow could occur. Only selectively adjusting the specific places where an overflow could occur seems largely no different than the current specific CVE-workaround to avoid the overflow.",
