Is that the right place for them?  It seems slightly unusual to me that we'd reference command line options in our general docs that are hidden away like this...?\r\n\r\n2) While `-limitancestorsize` and `-limitdescendantsize` have nice warnings now, I don't think I've updated any of the help text for `-limitancestorcount` and `-limitdescendantcount`.  I believe those limits are now only used by the wallet for coin selection.  Guessing I should include something in the release notes and in the help text for those options to explain this?\r\n\r\n3) In the release notes, would it be worth mentioning the switch from vsize-accounting to weight-accounting in the mempool and block building logic?  Or is that too in the weeds?",

I'd prefer (1).\r\n\r\nIn the release notes for 0.12.0, we referenced that there was a way to change the descendant limits without calling out what the command line argument was, and instead referred users to using `--help -help-debug` for more info.  I could do that in the release note snippet here as well, and perhaps leave the documentation in `doc/policy/mempool-design.md` as written, as that is more developer facing than user facing?\r\n\r\nAlso, I guess `-limitancestorcount` and `-limitdescendantcount` are both debug-only options anyway, so perhaps no need to mention their presence in the release notes either.

      "body": "# DRAFT: PR #X Decouple Datacarrier Size and Output Count Limits for Adaptable OP_RETURN Policy\n\nStatus: Draft | Target: Bitcoin Core v30.1 (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026) | Author: @jotapea\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn Bitcoin Core v30.0, transactions with multiple OP_RETURN/nulldata outputs are relayed by default, allowing up to 100,000 bytes. Effectively, this uncaps the total nulldata size per transaction, as the transaction size limit is hit first.\n\nThe scope of this PR is addressing the *outcome* of these changes, not the *reasons* for them. And this should be undeniable: **all Bitcoin software should incentivize nulldata over unspendable burn outputs for data.**\n\nHowever, the approach taken by v30.0's aggregated `datacarriersize` cap conflates per-output size with output count. It makes no distinction between a single contiguous data output, or this data being split between multiple outputs. While openly (defaulting to) relaying these data blobs, jumping from 83 bytes, to (<) 100,000 bytes (over 1000x increase).\n\nThis PR decouples the number of OP_RETURN outputs from the size of the outputs, to offer more granular limits control, while still supporting all features desired by Bitcoin node participants.\n\nWith just one additional configuration for nulldata relaying, Bitcoin Core can adapt to client configurations, and continue as the foundational Bitcoin node software of choice.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n- **-datacarrier** (bool, default: 1): A flag to toggle OP_RETURN relay. When set to 0, this disables OP_RETURN transactions entirely. No changes here.\n\n- **-datacarriersize** (int, default: 83): The maximum allowed byte size for any **individual** OP_RETURN output. The default is the historical cap of 83 bytes, but it can be any value. A value of 0 means no size limit. (Changed from v30.0, which redefined it as the **aggregate** of all nulldata outputs, while also making unlimited the default.)\n\n- **-datacarriercount** (int, default: 1): The maximum number of OP_RETURN outputs allowed per transaction. Setting this to 0 would allow an unlimited number of OP_RETURN outputs. This is the only new configuration. (Prior to v30.0, this was hardcoded to 1.)\n\nThe aggregate nulldata size limit becomes `datacarriersize` * `datacarriercount`.\n\n## Implementation\n\nTBD.\n\n### Configurations \n\nFor same policy as v30.0 / Libre Relay\n```conf\ndatacarrier=1\ndatacarriersize=0\ndatacarriercount=0\n# unlimited unsplit and split nulldata\n```\n\nDefaults proposed for v30.1 (historical default)\n```conf\ndatacarrier=1\ndatacarriersize=83\ndatacarriercount=1\n# single nulldata output with 83 bytes limit\n```\n\nCompromise: enough incentive over unspendable outputs (a new default possibility, but out of scope for this PR)\n```conf\ndatacarrier=1\ndatacarriersize=83\ndatacarriercount=0\n# unlimited split nulldata\n```\n\nKnots default\n```conf\ndatacarrier=1\ndatacarriersize=42\ndatacarriercount=1\n# single nulldata output with 42 bytes limit\n```\n\n\"Knots extreme\"\n```conf\ndatacarrier=0\n# no nulldata transactions relay\n```\n\n&lt;Customizable&gt;\n```conf\ndatacarrier=1\ndatacarriersize=100\ndatacarriercount=50\n# total size limit: 100*50 = 5000 bytes\n```\n\n## Benefits & Trade-offs\n\n### Pros:\n\n- Extends customization of OP_RETURN relay policy, with separate size and count limits, which cover the spectrum of nulldata carrying configurations used by Bitcoin node software.\n\n- Retains **money-first** defaults for `datacarriersize` and `datacarriercount` that mimic historic consensus.\n\n- The capacity to openly relay nulldata outputs is kept (no feature is lost from v30.0, is just reverting the defaults).\n\n### Cons:\n\n- Minor increase in configuration complexity due to the introduction of one more parameter, though this is mitigated by better configurability.\n\n- Reverts the datacarrier defaults from v30.0, making any *reason* for that change a possible *argument* against this PR. But that should be a separate issue pertaining the *New Datacarrier Defaults*.\n\n---\n---\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nThis can be a bit unusual, as there is no code yet for this. But that is the least of my worries.\n\nI just wanted to do something before [this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/d0f6d9953a15d7c7111d46dcb76ab2bb18e5dee3) highly controversial release.\n\nAll feedback is welcomed.\n",

You can refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md` to learn more about it, but to summarize:\n\n* It is not possible to open a feature or breaking change pull request directly to a release branch. If this was done, the change would be missing on the main staging branch for the next release and the feature or breaking change would \"undo itself\".\n* Point releases do not have strict target release aims, like major releases. They happen when they are needed. However, any code in point releases will have to be reviewed at least twice: When it is merged into master, and then again, when it is backported.

How do you think it would affect our test framework?\n\nPython is not thread-safe by design and there are no thread-safety annotations. Historically, this didn't matter much, because the GIL in the majority of cases will (by accident or by design?) add thread-safety. The tests may or may not pass without the GIL, but race conditions are now certainly observable. (I think we are adding locks where needed on a best-effort basis, but this hasn't been checked formally)\n\nYou can try this yourself locally:\n\n```\n$ cat /tmp/a.py   \nimport threading\n\ncounter = 0\n\ndef increment():\n    global counter\n    for _ in range(100000):\n        counter += 1\n\nthreads = [threading.Thread(target=increment) for _ in range(2)]\nfor t in threads:\n    t.start()\nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\n\nprint(counter)  # May not be 200000 due to race condition\n```\n\n```\n$ python3.10 /tmp/a.py\n200000\n\n$ python3.14t /tmp/a.py    \n129976\n```\n\nUnrelated(?), I am also pretty sure we violate RUF006 (https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/asyncio-dangling-task/). However, I haven't observed this Heisenbug in reality, so I didn't bother to ask for review. Generally, review for race fixes in the Python test code is slim at best (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33140 is waiting for months).\n\nSo generally, I'd exepct that long-term no-GIL will bring us more intermittent test failures and require fixes for them with no observable benefit.\n\nThough, maybe I am missing something?",
