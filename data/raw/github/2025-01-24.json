This PR implements serializing w/ all variants of `StringType` & add a functional test for the descriptor triggering the related issue.\r\n\r\nCloses #31694: previously when calling `listdescriptors` RPC on a wallet containing a taproot descriptor w/ a (miniscript) taptree, origins of internal key & taptree were serialized w/ differents hardened derivation markers: \r\n - origin of the internal key were serialized w/ `StringType::Normalized` type (using `h` as marker) \r\n - origins of taptree keys were serialized w/ `StringType::Private` type (using `'` as marker)\r\n \r\nNote: Origins in segwit (`wsh()`) miniscript descriptors were also serialized w/ `StringType::Private` type (`'` marker) and are now serialized w/ `StringType::Normalized` type (`h` marker).\r\n",
