However, I still somewhat prefer to explicitly and cleanly pass all CI options in a single Bash command, instead of taking anything that matches from the global env. For example, OpenSuse (or other Linux distros) may set `HOST` globally in the env, which is then taken by the CI system, because it is (correctly) recognized as a CI variable. The build will fail in that case. Similarly, if you exported `MAKEJOBS` previously, the CI will take that, and if you want to change it, it seems clearer to explicitly do it in the call. But no strong opinion. Happy to revert commit fa378bed56db66119b7f5847b749c4900b04c0a1 and push it here, if you think it is better. ",
