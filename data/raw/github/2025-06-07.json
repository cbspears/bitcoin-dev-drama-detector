You are exactly right. \r\n\r\nI made half hearted attempt to take yours and @achow101 's suggestions to make this test case work, but I think this is a bit more work that I would like to invest in this currently: 874064c781e822c8f7d49873e275e77f63acde86\r\n\r\nAFAICT, the test suite _only_ works for bech32 address types and is broken for all other address types - so a large overhaul for this test suite is needed to thoroughly test PSBT operations for all of our different utxo types (`legacy`, `p2sh-segwit`, `bech32`, and `bech32m` as of this writing). \r\n\r\nThere will also need to be new calculations done for hard coded values in the test suite. An example of that is [here](https://github.com/Christewart/bitcoin/blob/874064c781e822c8f7d49873e275e77f63acde86/test/functional/rpc_psbt.py#L553) when calculating approximate fee rates for transactions.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this for now as I am not going to continue working on it, if anyone else wants to pick up where I left off -- feel free.",

      "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nThe developer notes say that class/function/method names in newly added code should be UpperCamelCase:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e2174378aa8a339c7be8b4e91311513ed520a16d/doc/developer-notes.md?plain=1#L98-L99\n\nHowever, no recommendation is given for initialisms in class/function/method names. Searching DuckDuckGo for \"camelcase\" indicates a general consensus that the term \"CamelCase\" does not imply any particular policy here.\n\nThe existing codebase (unsurprisingly) is inconsistent here. For example, `HtmlEscape` and `JSONRPCRequest` both show up.\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e2174378aa8a339c7be8b4e91311513ed520a16d/src/qt/guiutil.h#L89\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e2174378aa8a339c7be8b4e91311513ed520a16d/src/wallet/rpc/util.h#L17\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nWhen writing new code for Bitcoin Core, developers don't know what style to use regarding initialisms. This produces unnecessary confusion, which is exacerbated when they grep the source code and find a mix of styles.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt would be nice if the developer notes could be updated to clarify this. (I do not particularly care what the policy should be, I would just like some policy to be there, so that developers know what's expected and the codebase can eventually converge toward a consistent style.)\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\nI guess the developer notes could be updated to instead say that there is no recommendation, and it's up to whichever developer is submitting the PR. This seems undesirable, since it means the codebase will never gain a more consistent style.\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
