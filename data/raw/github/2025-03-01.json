Could the downloaded file be compromised?\n\nI have attached screenshots of the VirusTotal and Avast analysis for your review.\n\nI look forward to your response. Thank you!\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9145f3ff-d1f2-4d48-b197-c62f17ae1726)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41404786-df72-4358-bfac-59c86bcf8d94)\n\n\n\n🇧🇷\n\nAssunto: 🚨 Bitcoin Core para MacOS - Possível Infecção por Minerador 🚨\n\nPrezados desenvolvedores do Bitcoin Core,\n\nBaixei o software Bitcoin Core diretamente do site oficial (bitcoincore.org) para macOS, e meu antivírus detectou um possível malware embutido no programa.\n\nO Avast identificou o arquivo como MacOS:Miner-AR [PUP], e ao verificar no VirusTotal, diversos outros antivírus também sinalizaram o software como um possível minerador.\n\nPara evitar que outros usuários sejam afetados, gostaria de confirmar se há alguma explicação oficial sobre isso. O arquivo baixado pode estar comprometido?\n\nAnexei prints da análise do VirusTotal e do Avast para facilitar a verificação.\n\nFico no aguardo de um retorno. Obrigado!\n\n\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n\n“I expected the Bitcoin Core installation file to be clean and free of any malware or suspicious activities. However, my antivirus detected a miner (MacOS:Miner-AR [PUP]), and a VirusTotal scan confirmed multiple detections from different security vendors. I would like to understand if this is a false positive or if the file has been compromised.”\n\n“Eu esperava que o arquivo de instalação do Bitcoin Core estivesse limpo e livre de qualquer malware ou atividades suspeitas. No entanto, meu antivírus detectou um minerador (MacOS:Miner-AR [PUP]), e a verificação no VirusTotal confirmou múltiplas detecções de diferentes fornecedores de segurança. Gostaria de entender se isso é um falso positivo ou se o arquivo foi comprometido.”\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\n\t1.\tDownloaded the Bitcoin Core installation file from the official website.\n\t2.\tScanned the file with Avast antivirus, which flagged it as containing MacOS:Miner-AR [PUP].\n\t3.\tUploaded the file to VirusTotal, where 8 out of 59 security vendors flagged it as malicious.\n\t4.\tThe detected threat is classified as a miner, potentially compromising system performance and security.\n\t5.\tSeeking clarification on whether this is a false positive or if the file has been compromised.\n\n\n\t1.\tBaixei o arquivo de instalação do Bitcoin Core a partir do site oficial.\n\t2.\tFiz uma varredura com o antivírus Avast, que detectou a ameaça MacOS:Miner-AR [PUP].\n\t3.\tEnviei o arquivo para o VirusTotal, onde 8 de 59 fornecedores de segurança o marcaram como malicioso.\n\t4.\tA ameaça detectada foi classificada como um minerador, o que pode comprometer o desempenho e a segurança do sistema.\n\t5.\tBusco esclarecimentos sobre se isso é um falso positivo ou se o arquivo foi comprometido.\n\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nOther\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nBitcoin Core 28.1\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nmacOS Sequoia 15.3.1 (Apple M2, MacBook Air 2022)\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
