If we add IPC fuzz tests in the repo they should not spawn separate processes and not do actual IPC over a socket. This is because the fuzz tests we have in our repo are designed to run in a single process.\r\n\r\nWe could add tests that call the c++ handler methods for the various interface functions either directly or through the capnp wrappers (only if possible without actual ipc). This should work and depending on the approach might not even require capnp as a dependency. This approach would likely suffer from instability due to state build up, just like the RPC fuzz tests.\r\n\r\nAnother approach could be to add IPC fuzz tests to fuzzamoto, where the test would essentially simulate an actual application connecting to the IPC interfaces (i.e. doing real IPC over a socket). The snapshot fuzzing approach would also avoid the state build up problem. This is the approach I would take, if I was gonna work on it.\r\n\r\nThere is also the question of what to target and what assurances it gives us. The IPC interface is trusted, so from a security perspective it's mostly uninteresting (e.g. a crash in this interface isn't considered a security issue). So really, we should mostly fuzz to gain confidence in stability and correctness, for which I'd suggest:\r\n\r\n* API fuzzing: basically calling \"random\" sequences of the available IPC functions (similar to our RPC tests). This would mostly aim at stability, i.e. there are no random unexpected crashes caused by edge case usage of the interface. It might be possible to leverage something like https://github.com/dergoegge/libcapnp-mutator to infer a \"grammar\" for fuzzing the API, because our capnp files already encode all the type and structural information for how to use the interface (`libcapnp-mutator` would need to be built out further for this to really work, but it might serve as a starting point). This would make the maintenance of this kind of test very easy, as any time we change the capnp files, the fuzzer would automatically learn about it and know how to fuzz it.\r\n* Correctness fuzzing: limit the scope of the above API fuzzing approach to a subset of interesting functions for which we can make assertions about expected behavior.",

It's been hard for me to think about what would constitute a meaningful fuzz test, and it still may not be exactly clear, but this provides a great framework. I just have two question\r\n\r\n> they should not spawn separate processes and not do actual IPC over a socket\r\n\r\nNot spawning separate processes makes sense, but I assumed it might be ok to communicate across an internal sockiet, e.g. with [socketpair](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html)? That is what a lot of IPC unit tests are doing.\r\n\r\n> The IPC interface is trusted, so from a security perspective it's mostly uninteresting (e.g. a crash in this interface isn't considered a security issue)\r\n\r\nThis is true currently, but it would be possible to make IPC interfaces that are untrusted by checking inputs more rigorously and adding resource caps like maximum number of threads or block templates (in case of the mining interface) an IPC client could create. So I'd be curious if it would affect the recommended fuzzing strategy if we did offer untrusted interfaces or decide to make the mining interface less trusted in the future.",
