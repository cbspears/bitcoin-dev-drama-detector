On the other hand, if the code is correct just closing the PR seems inappropriate.\n\nI looked at the PR, and while it appears \"correct\", it is randomly only changing `size_t` to `uint64_t` in half the places, even if they are on adjacent lines (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33712/files#diff-a9bf14cec48b76a03a785de76b8bc71c5db17d494c7f02c29dfde265c3acaf17). So closing it was the right approach. A minimal patch for the already worked around CVE would be to just patch serialize.h (like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33712/files#diff-1c0f9772bbdf8bfc283393a67c305b997a8ab9738d48c160e07d2fa56500a7a0). However, it seems better to consistently use fixed size int types in the affected code area, so I did that instead in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33724, with the patch split up in reviewable commits.",
