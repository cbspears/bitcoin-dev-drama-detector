Are we dropping support for the old runtime at the same time we switch to using the new ones in releases?\r\n\r\nYes, we are going to migrate the Windows release binaries to UCRT.\r\n\r\nHowever, the depends build subsystem has capabilities to build for a wider range of targets than those used in releases. This is well documented in README.md, which refers, for example, to `i686-pc-linux-gnu` and `s390x-linux-gnu`.\r\n\r\nWe are currently in a situation where:\r\n\r\n1. The codebase remains compatible with both MSVCRT and UCRT.\r\n\r\n2. Full UCRT-capable toolchains are not yet available across all major distributions.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, this PR is focused on adding the ability to build depends for the new target `x86_64-w64-mingw32ucrt`.\r\n\r\nIn my view, dropping support for `x86_64-w64-mingw32` should be considered separately and at a later stage, once the codebase becomes incompatible with MSVCRT or the toolchain landscape has matured.",

This follows the pattern established in #31981 (commit 74690f4) which refactored `TestBlockValidity()` in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n### Current Issues\r\n **ProcessNewBlockHeaders()**: Uses an out-parameter `BlockValidationState& state`, making the API less intuitive.\r\n\r\nAs noted by @theCharlatan in #33822 [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33822#discussion_r2508065115) and can be a fix for that too:\r\n> One thing that could be considered here is returning the BlockValidationState directly instead of having an in/out param. To safely do that I think we'd need to refactor ProcessNewBlockHeaders though, similarly to what was done in 74690f4.\r\n\r\nThe changes are split into two commits, see individual commit message for more info.",

When `m_disabled` is true, `ActivateBestChain` returns false without setting the `BlockValidationState` to invalid.

      "body": "During a reindex, the assumevalid setting may be ignored if the chainwork of the best header is below `minimumchainwork`. This happens when the previous IBD was stopped before connecting enough blocks to reach the required `minimumchainwork`. The assumevalid block will also be missing from the block index because the assumevalid block is set to match the `minimumchainwork`. See [Issue #31494](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31494).\r\n\r\nAs a result, `reindex` can take significantly longer to complete than necessary.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue by modifying reindex behaviour: if the chainwork of the `best_header` is below `minimumchainwork`, the node skips the `ActivateBestChain()` step and proceeds directly to synchronisation.\r\n\r\nThis PR takes a different approach from [PR #31615](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31615) to keep the validation path for `reindex` the same as the regular IBD validation path.\r\n\r\nDevelopers benchmarking IBD with `-reindex` may find this behaviour undesirable. In such cases, it’s recommended to use `-reindex-chainstate` instead or ensure that the available blocks have sufficient chainwork.\r\n\r\n`libbitcoinkernel` exposes the `ImportBlocks` function and expects `reindex` to connect blocks, so an attempt was made to preserve the existing behaviour for `libbitcoinkernel`.",

AV security assumption there is that the bad chain needs to have two weeks of work at a contemporary difficulty on top of it.  If an attacker is able to do that then there are other at-least-as-serious problems.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the attacker must either control enough hashpower to cause serious reorgs OR convince the users to actually patch/replace the software and not just reconfigure it.  (And of course, if they can convince the user of that-- it's game over as they can do anything).\r\n\r\nThis security assumption is documented in the source code:\r\n```\r\n                // The equivalent time check discourages hash power from extorting the network via DOS attack\r\n                //  into accepting an invalid block through telling users they must manually set assumevalid.\r\n                //  Requiring a software change or burying the invalid block, regardless of the setting, makes\r\n                //  it hard to hide the implication of the demand. \r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I think advising anywhere to change that value is not a good idea and that it was a mistake to make this value configurable on mainnet without clamping it to the hardcoded value... though #10357 doesn't really explain the motivation outside of test harnesses enough for me to say for certain.   As it is, however, it does break my security assumptions in a way that concerns me.\r\n\r\n",

Existing coverage relied on indirect behavior through addrman tests; these new cases exercise `Interpret` and `SanityCheckASMap` without large fixtures.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Introduce `src/test/asmap_tests.cpp` with helpers to synthesize compact asmap programs and five focused tests:\r\n  - verifies match vs default routing\r\n  - rejects tables missing a `RETURN`\r\n  - rejects `DEFAULT` immediately followed by `RETURN`\r\n  - enforces sufficient address-bit budgets\r\n  - rejects over-padded programs\r\n- Register the suite in `src/test/CMakeLists.txt`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- `cmake -S . -B build -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -DENABLE_IPC=OFF`\r\n- `cmake --build build --target test_bitcoin`\r\n- `build/bin/test_bitcoin --run_test=asmap_tests`",
