Bitcoin Core may assume that a coin is \"untrusted\" because it is unconfirmed and is not change, but it doesn't know that this coins is actually coming from a separate wallet that is also owned by the sender.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA config that allows to send untrusted utxos via the sendtoaddress api.
