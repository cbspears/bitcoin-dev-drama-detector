      "body": "Fixes #34573.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/34573#issuecomment-3891596958, the ThreadPool PR (#33689) revealed an existing issue.\r\n\r\nBefore that PR, we were returning an incorrect error \"Request rejected because http work queue depth exceeded\" during shutdown for unhandled requests (we were not differentiating between \"queue depth exceeded\" and \"server interrupted\" errors). Now, with the ThreadPool inclusion, we return the proper error but we don't handle it properly.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves exactly that. Handling the missing error and properly returning it to the user.\r\n\r\nThe race can be reproduced as follows:\r\n\r\n1) The server receives an http request.\r\n2) Processing of the request is delayed, and shutdown is triggered in the meantime.\r\n3) During shutdown, the libevent callback is unregistered and the threadpool interrupted.\r\n4) The delayed request (step 2) resumes and tries to submit a task to the now-interrupted server.\r\n\r\nReproduction test can be found https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/34577#issuecomment-3902672521.\r\n\r\nAlso, to prevent this kind of issue from happening again, this PR changes task submission\r\nto return the error as part of the function's return value using `util::Expected` instead of\r\nthrowing the exception. Unlike exceptions, which require extra try-catch blocks and can be\r\nignored, returning `Expected` forces callers to explicitly handle failures, and attributes\r\nlike `[[nodiscard]]` allow us catch unhandled ones at compile time.\r\n\r\n",

      "title": "validation: fetch block inputs on parallel threads 3x faster IBD",
      "body": "_Parts of this PR are isolated in independent smaller PRs to ease review:_\r\n\r\n* [x] _https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/34164_\r\n* [ ] _https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/34165_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR parallelizes fetching all input prevouts of a block during block connection, achieving over 3x faster IBD performance in some scenarios[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5].\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently, when fetching inputs in `ConnectBlock`, each input is fetched from the cache sequentially. A cache miss requires a round trip to the disk database to fetch the outpoint and insert it into the cache. Since the database is read-only during `ConnectBlock`, we can fetch all inputs of a block in parallel on multiple threads while connecting.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nWe introduce a new `CoinsViewCacheAsync` `CCoinsViewCache` subclass that manages worker threads to fetch block inputs in parallel. The block is passed to the `CoinsViewCacheAsync` view before entering `ConnectBlock`, which kicks off the worker threads to begin fetching the inputs. The view is then passed to `ConnectBlock` since it provides the same API as `CCoinsViewCache`. The cache returns fetched coins as they become available via the overridden `FetchCoin` method. If not available yet, the main thread also fetches coins as it waits.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Details\r\n\r\nThe `CoinsViewCacheAsync` implements a lock-free MPSC (Multiple Producer, Single Consumer) queue design:\r\n\r\n- **Work Distribution**: Collects all input prevouts into a queue and uses a barrier to start all worker threads simultaneously\r\n- **Synchronization**: Worker threads use an atomic counter to claim which inputs to fetch, and each input has an atomic flag to signal completion to the main thread\r\n- **Main Thread Processing**: The main thread waits for inputs in order and moves their `Coin` into the `cacheCoins` map as they become available.\r\n- **Work Stealing**: If the main thread catches up to the workers, it assists with fetching to maximize parallelism\r\n- **Completion**: All threads synchronize on a barrier via a `Reset` method, which ensures all threads are parked before proceeding\r\n\r\n### Safety and Correctness\r\n\r\n- The `CoinsViewCacheAsync` works on a block that has not been fully validated, but it does not interfere or modify any of the validation during `ConnectBlock`\r\n- It simply fetches inputs in parallel, which must be fetched before a transaction is validated anyways\r\n- **Invalid blocks**: If an invalid block is mined, the temporary cache is reset without being flushed. This is an improvement over the current behavior, where existing inputs are inserted into the main `CoinsTip()` cache when pulled through for an invalid block\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nBenchmarks show over 3x faster IBD performance in a cloud environment with network connected storage[^1], 3x faster IBD for an M4 Mac and up to 46% faster with directly connected storage[^2][^3][^4][^5]. The parallelization of expensive disk lookups provides significant speedup.\r\n\r\n[Flamegraphs show how the execution is changed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31132#issuecomment-3617315125).\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nInspired by [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18941#issuecomment-638553680).\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/34121.\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31132#issuecomment-3678847806\r\n[^2]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31132#pullrequestreview-3515011880\r\n[^3]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31132#issuecomment-3463894000\r\n[^4]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31132#pullrequestreview-3347436866\r\n[^5]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31132#issuecomment-3488760623",

      "title": "fees: Introduce Mempool Based Fee Estimation to reduce overestimation",
      "body": "This PR is another attempt to fix #27995 using a better approach.\r\n\r\nFor background and motivation, see #27995 and the discussion in the Delving Bitcoin post [Mempool Based Fee Estimation on Bitcoin Core](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703)\r\nThis PR is currently limited to using the mempool only to lower what is recommended by the Block Policy Estimator.\r\nAccurate and safe fee estimation using the mempool is challenging. There are open questions about how to prevent mempool games that are theoretically possible for miners [(a variant of the Finney attack)](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/6)\r\n\r\nThis is one of the reasons I opted to use the mempool only to lower the Block Policy Estimator, which itself is not gameable, and therefore this mechanism is not susceptible to this attack.\r\n\r\nThe underlying assumption here is that, with the current tools and work done to make RBF and CPFP feasible and guarantee (TRUC transaction relay, ephemeral anchors, cluster size 2 package rbf), it is safer to underestimate rather than overestimate.\r\nWe now assume it is relatively easy to fee-bump later if a transaction does not confirm, whereas once a fee is overestimated there is no way to recover from that.\r\n\r\nAnother open question when using the mempool for fee estimation is how to account for incoming transaction inflow.\r\n[Bitcoin Augur](https://github.com/block/bitcoin-augur) does this by using past inflow plus a constant expected inflow to predict future inflow. I find this unconvincing for fee estimation and potentially prone to more overestimation, as past conditions are not always representative of the future. See my [review of the Augur fee rate estimator and open questions](https://github.com/block/bitcoin-augur/issues/3).\r\n\r\nThis PR uses a much simpler approach based on current user behavior, similar to the widely used method employed by mempool.space: looking at the top block of the mempool and selecting a percentile feerate depending on whether the user is economical or conservative.\r\n\r\nEmpirical data from both myself and Clara Shikhelman shows that the 75th percentile feerate for economical users and the 50th percentile feerate for conservative users provide positive confirmation guarantees, hence this is what is used in this PR.\r\n\r\nParallel research by René Pickhardt and his student suggests that using the [average fee per byte of the block template performs well](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/12).\r\n\r\nAll of these are constants that can be adjusted, there is parallel work exploring these constants and running benchmarks across fee estimators to find a sweet spot.\r\n\r\nSee also work in LND, the [LND Budget Sweeper](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/lnds-deadline-aware-budget-sweeper/1512), which applies this idea successfully. Their approach is to estimate fees initially with bitcoind, then increment gradually as the confirmation deadline approaches, using a fixed fee budget.\r\n\r\nHistorical data indicates that by doing only the approach in this PR, we are able to [reduce overestimation quite significantly (~29%)](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/8).\r\n\r\nThis is particularly useful in scenarios where the Block Policy Estimator recommends a high feerate while the mempool is empty.\r\n<img width=\"1800\" height=\"1090\" alt=\"56f3ba26c0184521c42bb82ec9d8c9f2224d4f8e\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c035c40c-8ece-42a7-b290-d29f1ac9bf4d\" />\r\n\r\nAs seen in the image above, there is only one remaining unfixed case: when there is a sudden inflow of transactions and the feerate rises, the Block Policy Estimator takes time to reflect this. In that case, users will continue to see a low feerate estimate until it slowly updates. From the historical data linked above, [this occurs about ~26% of the time](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/8)).\r\n\r\nOverall, we observe a **73% success rate with 0% overestimation, and 26% underestimation** with this approach.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes refactors that enable this work. Rather than splitting the PR and implementing changes incrementally, I opted for an end-to-end implementation:\r\n\r\n### 1. Refactors\r\n\r\n* Separation of feerate format from the fee estimate mode enumerator (separation of concerns, as they are semantically distinct)\r\n* Move logging after fee estimation estimateSmartFee from the wallet to the Block Policy Estimator internal method (also separation of concerns and avoiding leaking fee estimator internals). This change also comes with updating `createTransactionInternal` to log only the fee and its source (fee estimator, fallback fee, etc.), which is more appropriate.\r\n* Separate the fee estimate mode enum from the fee source enumerator (separation of concerns, as they are semantically distinct). This introduces a minor breaking change: the wallet RPCs now return fee *source* instead of fee *reason*, which is more accurate. Let me know if we prefer to keep the field name unchanged while returning the fee source.\r\n* Move the `StringForReason` enum from `common` to the Block Policy Estimator (also separation of concerns)\r\n* Various test file updates and renames for improved accuracy\r\n* Update Block Policy Estimator unit tests to be independent of the mempool and the validation interface\r\n\r\n### 2. Introduce Mempool-Based Fee Estimator and Fee Estimator Manager\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new abstract fee estimator base class that all fee estimators must implement\r\n\r\n* Introduce `FeeRateEstimateResult` as the response type, containing metadata and avoiding the use of out-parameters. This is easily extensible and makes future changes less invasive, as method signatures do not need to change.\r\n\r\n* Add `FeeEstimatorType` enum to identify different fee estimators\r\n\r\n* Make `CBlockPolicyEstimator` derive from the new fee estimator base class\r\n\r\n* Add `FeeRateEstimatorManager`, responsible for managing all fee estimators\r\n\r\n* Update the node context to store a `unique_ptr` to `FeeRateEstimatorManager` instead of `CBlockPolicyEstimator`\r\n\r\n* Update `CBlockPolicyEstimator` to no longer subscribe directly to the validation interface; instead, `FeeRateEstimatorManager` subscribes and forwards relevant notifications\r\n\r\n* Add a percentile calculation function that takes the chunk feerates of a block template and returns feerate percentiles; this can also be reused by the `getblockstats` RPC\r\n\r\n* Add a mempool fee estimator that generates a block template when called, calculates a percentile feerate, and returns the 75th percentile for economical mode or the 50th percentile for conservative mode\r\n\r\n* Add caching to the mempool estimator so that new estimates are generated only every 7 seconds, assuming enough [transactions have propagated](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/125776/how-long-does-it-take-for-a-transaction-to-propagate-through-the-network/125777#125777) to make a meaningful difference.\r\n  This heuristic will likely be replaced by requesting block templates via the general-purpose block template cache proposed here: [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33389](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33389)\r\n\r\n* Update `MempoolTransactionRemovedForBlock` to return the actual block transactions as well\r\n\r\n* Track the weight of block transactions and evicted transactions after each block connection\r\n  This data is tracked for the last 6 mined blocks. A mempool feerate estimate is returned only when the average ratio of mempool transaction weight evicted due to `BLOCK` reasons to block transaction weight is greater than 75%. This heuristic provides rough confidence that the node’s mempool matches that of the majority of the hashrate. The 75% threshold is arbitrary and can be adjusted.\r\n\r\nThere is a caveat when transactions in the local mempool are consistently not mined by the network, as described in #27995 (e.g., due to filtering).\r\nAccounting for these transactions during fee estimation is not necessary, as they should be evicted from the mempool itself (see #33510). Handling this again within fee estimation would be redundant.\r\n\r\n* Persist statistics for the 6 most recent blocks to disk during periodic flushes and shutdown, so this data is available after restarts\r\n* Expose this data to users when running `estimatesmartfee` with verbosity > 2\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>see example output</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli estimatesmartfee 1 \"conservative\" 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"feerate\": 0.00002133,\r\n  \"errors\": [],\r\n  \"blocks\": 2,\r\n  \"mempool_health_statistics\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"block_height\": 927953,\r\n      \"block_weight\": 3991729,\r\n      \"mempool_txs_weight\": 3942409,\r\n      \"ratio\": 0.987644451815241\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>",

However, in reality it will blindly send all blocks and then return early, when done or when a disconnect happens. This will cause test failures when python is running faster than Bitcoin Core, for example when using sanitizers.\r\n* The `assert_debug_log` scopes are bloated, which makes finding the above issue harder. This is, because a test failure will basically print the 1000+ line debug log excerpt twice, with the second instance stripped of useful python test logs. Also, the checks are less precise, if they happen over a larger scope/snippet.\r\n\r\nFix all issues, by:\r\n\r\n* Removing `send_blocks_until_disconnected` and just sending the blocks that are needed to get the disconnect and then explicitly waiting for the disconnect.\r\n* Reduce the scopes of the debug log checks. This can be reviewed with the git options `--color-moved=dimmed-zebra --color-moved-ws=ignore-all-space`.",

(#13298).\r\n\r\nHowever, having a single timer for inbounds of all networks is also an obvious fingerprinting vector: Connecting to a suspected pair of privacy-network and clearnet addresses and observing the `inv` pattern makes it trivial to confirm or refute that they are the same node.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it such that a separate timer is used for each network.\r\nIt uses the existing method  from `getaddr` caching and generalizes it to be saved in a new field `m_network_key` in `CNode` which will be used for both `getaddr` caching and `inv` scheduling, and can also be used for any future anti-fingerprinting measures.",

      "body": "The `external_signer` indicates that an external signer device may be called via [HWI](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI) or [equivalent](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md#signer-api) application.\r\n\r\nWhen it was initially introduced some additional constraints were placed on wallets with this flag: it had to be a descriptor wallet and watch-only. Also the flag could not be added or removed later.\r\n\r\nThe constraints aren't a problem for the main supported and documented use case of connecting a single hardware wallet and using it just like a normal single sig Bitcoin Core wallet.\r\n\r\nBut they get in the way of more advanced constructions, which are becoming increasingly practical especially once MuSig2 support lands with #29675. See https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/91 and https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/pull/794 for a collection of changes on top of that which facilitate MuSig2 with a hardware wallet. And see #24861.\r\n\r\nThis pull requests drops the following constraints:\r\n\r\n- `disable_private_keys` is no longer mandatory (but still default)\r\n- `external_signer` flag is now mutable\r\n\r\nAdditionally it does the following:\r\n\r\n- make the `blank` option for `createwallet` consistent with regular wallets by _not_ importing keys from the connected signer\r\n- avoid going through `createTransaction` for external signers (otherwise the GUI breaks)\r\n- update `external-signer.md` mainly to use named arguments and point out a GUI setting\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should no noticeable effect on the default single sig use case described above.\r\n\r\n \r\n",

      "body": "This PR implements symlink detection for Windows, since GCC [doesn't support symlinks on Windows](https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=blob;f=libstdc%2B%2B-v3/src/filesystem/ops-common.h;h=ba377905a2e90f7baf30c900b090f1f732397e08;hb=refs/heads/releases/gcc-13#l124). This is used by the wallet's `ListDatabases` in order to detect symlinks and avoid recursing them. It's also used in wallet path validation since that is also checking whether paths are symlinks, and we should properly detect symlinks on Windows.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, the `IsSymlink` function uses `std::filesystem::is_symlink` for non-Windows systems. On Windows, it checks a file's attributes to determine if it is a [reparse point](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/reparse-points). Strictly speaking, this will also catch files that aren't symlinks, such as directories that are Onedrive mounts. I think it's fine to not be recursively searching such directories.\r\n\r\nThis is based on #34418 for the multiwallet test and CI changes that it enables. The last commit also removes the skipping of the symlink checks so that we are testing that the symlink handling behavior on Windows matches that on Linux and MacOS.",

We've dropped the usage of `DynamicMemoryUsage` as it's the wrong metric, even before the non-wiping flushes were introduced (if everything is dirty, memory usage is correlated with, but not the same as, the amount of disk space written or used). They could be improved by keeping track of proper write size estimates in a follow-up, but here we're just using a fixed 48 bytes per entry estimate.",

This eliminates hand-rolled separators and makes peer identification predictable.\r\nMinor issues (double spaces, empty placeholders, format specifiers) are fixed along the way in separate commits.\r\n\r\n### Reproducer\r\nRun with `-debug=net -logips=1` and observe peer log lines now show `peer=<id>, peeraddr=<addr>` (comma-separated).

Containerfile layer optimisations reduce rebuild frequency further.\r\n\r\n`ty` is significantly faster/more modern/maintained than `mypy`, and configured declaratively.\r\n\r\nAdding root-level `[ty|ruff].toml` config files means contributors can easily run `ty check` or `ruff check` locally without running the full linter, along with being accessible to other tooling (similarly for requriements.txt).\r\n\r\nPinning tool versions in the dockerfile makes it more excplicit and easier to find.\r\n\r\nThe tradeoff we make here is that there is no longer a bare install script to install tooling on a local machine. However I think this is OK, as it currently only works for `apt`-based OSes anyway, and I don't think running the linter outside of the container is such a valuable use-case as it is with some of the other CI jobs.\r\n\r\nFurther work can drop individual rules from `ty.toml` fixing up the infringing code as necessary.\r\n\r\nI can split this up if wanted, but IMO it makes sense to do it altogether.",

      "body": "  This PR fixes two related issues with address discovery when using explicit bind addresses in Bitcoin Core:\r\n\r\n  -  #31293\r\n  -  #31336\r\n\r\nWhen using `-bind=0.0.0.0:port` (or `-bind=::`), the `Discover()` function was not being executed because the code only checked the `bind_on_any` flag. This led to two problems:\r\n- The node would not discover its own local addresses if an explicit \"any\" bind was used.\r\n- The functional test `feature_bind_port_discover.py` would fail, as it expects local addresses to be discovered in these cases.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n1. Checks both `bind_on_any` and any bind addresses using `IsBindAny()`\r\n   Ensures `Discover()` runs when binding to 0.0.0.0 or ::, even if specified explicitly.\r\n2. Ensures correct address discovery\r\n   The node will now discover its own addresses when using explicit \"any\" binds, matching user expectations and fixing the test.\r\n3. Maintains backward compatibility\r\n   The semantic meaning of `bind_on_any` is preserved as defined in `net.h`:  \r\n   > \"True if the user did not specify -bind= or -whitebind= and thus we should bind on 0.0.0.0 (IPv4) and :: (IPv6)\"\r\n4. Updates the test to use dynamic ports\r\n   The functional test `feature_bind_port_discover.py` is updated to use dynamic ports instead of hardcoded ones, improving reliability.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n- Implementation follows the approach proposed in my [review comment on #31492](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31492#issuecomment-2941773645).\r\n\r\nCloses #31293\r\n\r\nThe #31336 has the overall test failure and requires both this PR and #33362 to be fully resolved.\r\n",

It simplifies init, shutdown and requests execution logic.\r\nReplacing code that was never unit tested for code that is properly unit and fuzz tested.\r\nAlthough our functional test framework extensively uses this RPC interface (that’s how\r\nwe’ve been ensuring its correct behavior so far - which is not the best).\r\n\r\nThis clearly separates the responsibilities:\r\nThe HTTP server now focuses solely on receiving and dispatching requests, while ThreadPool handles\r\nconcurrency, queuing, and execution.\r\n\r\nThis will also allows us to experiment with further performance improvements at the task queuing and\r\nexecution level, such as a lock-free structure or task prioritization or any other implementation detail\r\nlike coroutines in the future, without having to deal with HTTP code that lives on a different layer.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThe rationale behind introducing the ThreadPool first is to be able to easily cherry-pick it across different\r\nworking paths. Some of the ones that are benefited from it are #26966 for the parallelization of the indexes\r\ninitial sync, #31132 for the parallelization of the inputs fetching procedure, #32061 for the libevent replacement,\r\nthe kernel API #30595 (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30595#discussion_r2413702370) to avoid blocking validation among others use cases not publicly available.\r\n\r\nNote 2:\r\nI could have created a wrapper around the existing code and replaced the `WorkQueue` in a subsequent\r\ncommit, but it didn’t seem worth the extra commits and review effort. The `ThreadPool` implements\r\nessentially the same functionality in a more modern and cleaner way.",

      "title": "refactor: Add util::Result failure types and ability to merge result values",
      "body": "Add `util::Result` support for returning more error information and make use of it in [LoadChainstate method](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665/commits/0263614685582fed2290494f5233dbe038fc350c) as an initial application. Followup PRs [#25722](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25722) and [#29700](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700) use it more broadly to return errors and warnings from wallet and kernel functions as well.\r\n\r\nThis change adds two major features to the result class:\r\n\r\n- For better error handling, adds the ability to return a value on failure, not just a value on success. This is a key missing feature that makes the result class not useful for functions like `LoadChainstate()` which produce different errors that need to be handled differently [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Ability to return error values was actually present in the original implementation of [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218), but unfortunately removed in later iterations. See [design notes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/util::Result-design-notes).\r\n\r\n- For better error reporting, adds the ability to return warning messages and multiple errors, not just a single error string. This provides a way for functions to report errors and warnings in a standard way, and simplifies interfaces:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -virtual std::unique_ptr<Wallet> loadWallet(const std::string& name, bilingual_str& error, std::vector<bilingual_str>& warnings) = 0;\r\n    +virtual util::Result<std::unique_ptr<Wallet>> loadWallet(const std::string& name) = 0;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options, DatabaseStatus& status, bilingual_str& error);\r\n    +util::Result<std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase>, DatabaseError> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options);\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis change also makes some more minor improvements:\r\n\r\n- Smaller type size. `util::Result<int>` is 16 bytes, and `util::Result<void>` is 8 bytes. Previously both were 72 bytes.\r\n\r\n- Broader type compatibility. Supports noncopyable and nonmovable success and error types.\r\n\r\n### Comparison with `std::expected`\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `util::Result` class is useful for error reporting—returning translated, user-facing error strings—but not as useful for error handling, where callers need structured failure information to decide how to proceed. By contrast, `std::expected` / `util::Expected` (#34005, #34006) is good for error handling but less helpful for reporting. This PR closes the gap between the two classes.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, `std::expected` remains a good choice for lower-level functions or simple functions that fail in only a few well-defined ways. Meanwhile,\r\n\r\n- `Result` becomes a better choice for operations that can fail in many different ways—loading a wallet, connecting a block, etc.—where callers may want complete error traces, not just low-level errors without context or high-level errors without detail. (Followup [#25722](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25722) applies this to wallet-loading functions.) \r\n- `Result` can also be more useful than `expected` when merging status information from multiple calls. (Followup [#29700](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700) uses this to reliably propagate flush and fatal-error status from validation code that can internally trigger flushes or shutdowns.)\r\n- `Result` may also be a better choice than `std::expected` when returning pointer values. (Followup [#26022](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26022) adds a `ResultPtr` specialization that avoids double dereferencing.) \r\n- `Result` can be more efficient than `std::expected` when failures are rare but failure objects are large, since failure values are heap-allocated.\r\n\r\nThis PR effectively makes `Result` a superset of `expected`, making the representations compatible and allowing them to be used together.",

Also when it is used in a boolean context, instead of evaluating to true when there is no error and the pointer is null, it evaluates to false so it is straightforward to determine whether the result points to something.\n\nThis PR is only partial a solution to #26004 because while it makes it easier to check for null pointer values, it does not make it impossible to return a null pointer value inside a successful result.

      "body": "### Motivation\r\n\r\n`TxOrphanage` needs to look up orphan announcements in two different orders — by `(wtxid, peer)` for transaction lookups, and by `(peer, reconsider, sequence)` for per-peer iteration and eviction. \r\n\r\nCurrently this is done with `boost::multi_index_container`, one of the last remaining Boost uses in the codebase. This PR removes it in favor of standard library containers, contributing to the ongoing effort to eliminate the Boost dependency from bitcoind.\r\n\r\n### Approach\r\n\r\nReplace the `boost::multi_index_container` with a hand-rolled `AnnouncementIndex` class wrapping two `std::map` containers cross-linked by iterators:\r\n\r\n- **`m_by_wtxid`** `std::map<(Wtxid, NodeId), Announcement>` — owns the data\r\n- **`m_by_peer`** `std::map<(NodeId, bool, Seq), WtxidMap::iterator>` — stores cross-references, no data duplication\r\n\r\n`std::map` iterator stability guarantees that cross-references remain valid across insertions and erasures of other elements. All mutations go through `AnnouncementIndex` member functions (`Insert`/`Erase`/`SetReconsider`) to keep both indices in sync, with `Assume()` assertions verifying every mutation.\r\n\r\nNo behavior change. \r\n\r\n### Operation mapping\r\n\r\n| Operation | Before (boost) | After (AnnouncementIndex) |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| **Insert** | `m_orphans.get<ByWtxid>().emplace(tx, peer, seq)` | `m_orphans.Insert(tx, peer, seq)` |\r\n| **Erase** | `m_orphans.get<Tag>().erase(it)` | `m_orphans.Erase(it)` (overloaded) |\r\n| **Modify reconsider** | `index.modify(it, [](auto& a){ a.m_reconsider = val; })` | `m_orphans.SetReconsider(it, val)` |\r\n| **Project peer→wtxid** | `m_orphans.project<ByWtxid>(peer_it)` | `m_orphans.ToWtxid(peer_it)` |\r\n| **Access field** | `it->m_tx` | `Ann(it).m_tx` |\r\n",

      "title": "kernel: Add block header support and validation",
      "body": "Adds a new `btck_BlockHeader` type and associated functions to create, access, and validate block headers. Block headers will have their own type (`btck_BlockHeader`) that can be created from raw data, copied, and queried for all the standard header fields (hash, prev hash, timestamp, bits, version, nonce). We can also extract headers from full blocks or block tree entries.\r\n\r\nThe first commit here refactors `BlockValidationState` to use Handle/View pattern so external code can own them, which is required for the header processing in the API.\r\n\r\n #### New Block Header API\r\n\r\n  - **`btck_BlockHeader` type**: Opaque handle for block headers\r\n  - **Header methods**:\r\n    - `btck_block_header_create()`: Create header from 80-byte serialized data\r\n    - `btck_block_header_copy()`: Copy block headers\r\n    - `btck_block_header_destroy()`: Destroy header object\r\n    - `btck_block_header_get_hash()`: Calculate block hash\r\n    - `btck_block_header_get_prev_hash()`: Get previous block hash\r\n    - `btck_block_header_get_timestamp()`: Get block timestamp\r\n    - `btck_block_header_get_bits()`: Get difficulty target (compact format)\r\n    - `btck_block_header_get_version()`: Get block version\r\n    - `btck_block_header_get_nonce()`: Get proof-of-work nonce\r\n    \r\n    - `btck_block_get_header()`: Extract header from a full block\r\n    - `btck_block_tree_entry_get_block_header()`: Get header associated with a block tree entry\r\n  \r\n  - **Header Processing Methods:**\r\n    - **`btck_chainstate_manager_process_block_header()`**: Validates and processes a block header without requiring the full block. This performs proof-of-work verification, timestamp validation, and updates the internal chain state.\r\n    - **`btck_chainstate_manager_get_best_entry()`**: Returns the block tree entry with the most cumulative proof-of-work.\r\n\r\nWhy `btck_chainstate_manager_get_best_entry()` is included alongside header validation? Just as we have logic to get the tip for block validation (so you can request more blocks extending your best from your peers), we need the equivalent for header validation. To make header validation worthwhile, knowing what the best current header is seems useful—it tells you what headers to request next from peers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ### Testing\r\n\r\n  Added tests in `test_kernel.cpp` that cover creating headers from raw data, extracting all header fields, and processing headers through the chainstate manager.\r\n  \r\n  CC sedited",

      "title": "(RFC) kernel: Replace leveldb-based BlockTreeDB with flat-file based store",
      "body": "Opening this PR mostly to get concept/approach feedback.\r\n\r\nThis is motivated by the kernel library, where the internal usage of leveldb is a limiting factor to its future use cases. Specifically it is not possible to share leveldb databases between two processes. A notable use-case for the kernel library is accessing and analyzing existing block data. Currently this can only be done by first shutting down the node writing this data. Moving away from leveldb opens the door towards doing this in parallel. A flat file based approach was chosen, since the requirements for persistence here are fairly simple (no deletion, constant-size entries). The change also offers better performance by making node startup faster, and has a smaller on-disk footprint, though this is negligible in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nThe BlockTreeStore introduces a new data format for storing block indexes and headers on disk. The class is very similar to the existing CBlockTreeDB, which stores the same data in a leveldb database. Unlike CBlockTreeDB, the data stored through the BlockTreeStore is directly serialized and written to flat .dat files. The storage schema introduced\r\nis simple. It relies on the assumption that no entry is ever deleted and that no duplicate entries are written. These assumptions hold for the current users of CBlockTreeDB.\r\n\r\nA write ahead ahead log and boolean flags as file existence checks ensure write atomicity. Every data entry is also given a crc32c checksum to detect data corruption.\r\n\r\nThe change also opens the door towards getting rid of having to reindex the block tree due to corruption (though switching from pruned -> un-pruned still requires extra logic). This would simplify a lot of kernel/validation code, as can be seen in this [commit](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commit/bfb2709e1d116d4e613601c3f0140f099530159d#diff-28f178018e05634ee3f8ddce3f4e0cec334ae69915cecf92be8299c749d8d470). The implementation here should be fairly robust against corruption (no parallel read/writes, no background compaction).\r\n\r\nAn alternative to this pull request, that could allow the same kernel feature, would be closing and opening the leveldb database only when reading and writing. This might incur a (negligible) performance penalty, but more importantly requires careful consideration of how to handle any contentions when opening, which might have complex side effects due to our current locking mode. It would also be possible to introduce an existing database with the required features for just the block tree, but that would introduce reliance on a new dependency and come with its own tradeoffs. For these reasons I chose this approach.",

      "body": "This is a slightly modified version of the first few commits of #31132, which can be merged as an independent change. It has a small benefit on its own, but will help in moving the parent PR forward.\r\n\r\nWhen accessing coins via the `CCoinsViewCache`, methods like `GetCoin` can call `FetchCoin` which actually mutate `cacheCoins` internally to cache entries when they are pulled from the backing db. This is generally a performance improvement for single threaded access patterns, but it precludes us from accessing entries in a `CCoinsViewCache` from multiple threads without a lock.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect is that when we use the resettable `CCoinsViewCache` view backed by the main cache for use in `ConnectBlock()`, we will insert entries into the main cache even if the block is determined to be invalid. This is not the biggest concern, since an invalid block requires proof-of-work. But, an attacker could craft multiple invalid blocks to fill the main cache. This would make us `Flush` the cache more often than necessary. Obviously this would be very expensive to do on mainnet.\r\n\r\nIntroduce `CoinsViewOverlay`, a `CCoinsViewCache` subclass that reads coins without mutating the underlying cache via `FetchCoin()`.\r\n\r\nAdd `PeekCoin()` to look up a Coin through a stack of `CCoinsViewCache` layers without populating parent caches. This prevents the main cache from caching inputs pulled from disk for a block that has not yet been fully validated. Once `Flush()` is called on the view, these inputs will be added as spent to `coinsCache` in the main cache via `BatchWrite()`.\r\n\r\nThis is the foundation for async input fetching, where worker threads must not mutate shared state.\r\n",

This last part add the initial asmap data, implements the build changes and adds further documentation.\r\n\r\nCurrently an asmap file needs to be acquired by there user from some location or the user needs to generate one themselves. Then they need to move the file to the right place in datadir or pass the path to the file as `-asmap=PATH` in order to use the asmap feature. The change here allows for builds to embed asmap data into the bitcoind binary which makes it possible to use the feature without handling of the asmap file by the user. If the user starts bitcoind with `-asmap` the embedded data will be used for bucketing of nodes.\r\n\r\nThe data lives in the repository at `src/node/data/ip_asn.dat` and can be replaced with a new version at any time. The idea is that the data should be updated with every release. By default the data at that location is embedded into the binary but there is also a build option to prevent this (`-DWITH_EMBEDDED_ASMAP=OFF`). In this case the original behavior of the `-asmap` option is maintained.",

      "title": "refactor: disentangle miner startup defaults from runtime options",
      "body": "The interaction between node startup options like `-blockreservedweight` and runtime options, especially those passed via IPC, is confusing.\r\n\r\nThey're combined in `BlockAssembler::Options`, which this PR gets rid of in favour of two distinct structs:\r\n\r\n1. `BlockCreateOptions`: used by interface clients. As before, IPC clients have access to a safe / sane subset, whereas RPC and test code can use all fields.\r\n2. `MiningArgs`: these are set once during node startup\r\n\r\nBoth structs have a member for the maximum block height, which is not a problem since they're different structs. The one on `MiningArgs` (`block_max_weight`) matches `-maxblockheight` and is left alone. The one on `BlockCreateOptions` (`block_max_weight`) is an optional, it's set by `ApplyMiningDefaults` only if empty. \r\n\r\nThis all happens in the last commit and requires some preparation to keep things easy to review.\r\n\r\nWe get rid of `BlockAssembler::Options` but this is used in many tests. Since large churn is inevitable, we might as well switch all tests, bench and fuzzers over to the Mining interface. The first (non-base) commit does that, dramatically reducing direct use of `BlockAssembler`. Two exceptions are documented in the commit message. Because `test_block_validity` wasn't available via the interface and the block_assemble benchmark needs it, it's moved from `BlockAssembler::Options` to `BlockCreateOptions` (still not exposed via IPC).\r\n\r\nWe need access to mining related defaults and structs from both the miner and node initialization code. To avoid having to pull in all of `BlockAssembler` for the latter, the second commit introduces `node/mining.h` and moves constants and structs there from `src/node/types.h` (`BlockCreateOptions`, `BlockWaitOptions`, `BlockCheckOptions`) and `src/node/miner.h` (`DEFAULT_PRINT_MODIFIED_FEE`).\r\n\r\nI considered also moving `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_WEIGHT`, `DEFAULT_BLOCK_RESERVED_WEIGHT`, `MINIMUM_BLOCK_RESERVED_WEIGHT` and `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MIN_TX_FEE` there from `policy.h`, since they are distinct from relay policy and not needed by the kernel. But this seems more appropriate for a follow-up and requires additional discussion.\r\n\r\nThe meat and potatoes of this PR is split between the three last commits for easier review:\r\n\r\n1. Adds `node/mining_args.{h,cpp}` and move the options checking out of `init.cpp`, without adding storage\r\n2. Add `block_max_weight` to `BlockCreateOptions` as explained above\r\n3. Introduce the `MiningArgs` struct, add it to the `NodeContext`, expand `mining_args.cpp` to store it, pass it to `BlockAssembler`, etc.\r\n\r\nI kept variable renaming and other formatting changes to a minimum to ease review with `--color-moved=dimmed-zebra`.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on the bug fix in:\r\n- [ ] #33965\r\n\r\nOnce that is merged, this PR should not change behaviour.",

      "title": "Implementation of SwiftSync",
      "body": "Link to the original protocol writeup found [here](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/a61a37d14182ccd78760e477c78133cd). See the [Delving Bitcoin post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/swiftsync-speeding-up-ibd-with-pre-generated-hints-poc/1562) for initial works and discussion.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nWhile many coins are available in cache when spent, every cache miss requires a trip to the disk. Memory can be scarce for single board machines, so cache misses are expected to be far more frequent. A trip to disk is all-the-more severe on low end hardware, so any minimization of disk interactions can speed up initial block download for limited resource devices. One such example may be a block template provider serving a home miner.\r\n\r\n# Intuition\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of coins created are later spent. The cost of this observation is many coins will be written to disk, only to be removed later. The SwiftSync protocol alleviates the problem by recording what coins have been added and removed with a small, in-memory aggregate. This allows for the removal of intermediate coin states until SwiftSync has completed. The state of the aggregate is verified at a predetermined chain height, and IBD continues as usual thereafter.\r\n\r\nFor any chain height, we know `all outputs - all inputs = UTXO set`, which is equivalently `all outputs - UTXO set = all inputs`. The goal is to verify the set `all outputs - UTXO set` is equal to `all inputs`. Addition and subtraction modulo a field offers a way to do so. For any set, if we add all elements of the set and subtract them, regardless of ordering, we will arrive at zero. In the current implementation, the set elements being compared are hashed outpoints.\r\n\r\nThe SwiftSync protocol is comprised of two structures. First, the aggregate that will record the state of what outpoints have been added (created) or subtracted (spent). Next, notice that the UTXO set must be reported in order to verify `all outputs - UTXO set = all inputs`. SwiftSync introduces a hints file, which may be provided to the client at startup. This hints file is nothing more than a pointer to each unspent output by recording the block height and the indexes that will remain unspent. By using this file, a client may omit outpoints that will be in the UTXO set when updating the aggregate. Note this file is not trusted. If a malicious actor provides a faulty UTXO set, the set comparison above will fail, and the client may begin a reindex.\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\n## Aggregate\r\n\r\nThe hash aggregate takes outpoints, hashes them with a salted hasher, and updates 4, 64-bit limbs with wrapping modulo arithmetic. The choice of 4, 64-bit limbs with no carries between limbs was made to: 1. minimize code complexity within the aggregate 2. conform to existing APIs, namely `uint256`. After adding and subtracting some arbitrary list of outpoints, we may poll if the sets were equivalent with `IsZero`.\r\n## Hintsfile\r\n\r\nThe hints file is a map of block height to the indexes of the outputs in that block that _will_ be in the UTXO set. To construct this file for a particular UTXO set state, each block must be read and queried to find the outputs in that block that remain unspent. Because this is a read-only operation, this may be done on parallel threads in the future. To allow for parallelization, the hints file contains a \"contents\" section, which denotes the height and corresponding file position to find the hints for that block.\r\n\r\nTo save space when representing the indexes that remain unspent in a block, an easy choice is to take the difference between the last coin that was unspent and the next one in the block. AFICT this is a version of run-length-encoding. These indexes are encoded using `compactSize` to further save space, the run-lengths should normally fit into at least 16 bits, often 8 bits.\r\n## Parameter Interaction\r\n\r\nA side effect of omitting intermediate UTXO states while performing IBD is the \"undo data\" cannot be derived. There are already configurations that do not have full undo data history, namely pruned nodes. To avoid additional complexity in this PR, this version of accelerated IBD is only made available to pruned nodes, as the undo data would have been removed regardless of the this setting.\r\n\r\nOther parameter interactions, not yet implemented:\r\n- `assumeutxo`: Startup should fail if both are configured. A hints file will have no effect, as the UTXO set is already present.\r\n- `assumevalid`: A natural choice is to only allow SwiftSync when using `assumevalid`, and to only allow a hints file that commits to the `assumevalid` block. Similar to `assumeutxo`, a hash of the hints file may be committed to in the binary, which would be resistant to griefing attacks.\r\n# Testing [Linux example]\r\n\r\nIn your `bitcoin` directory, download the hints from the test server:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -o signet.hints https://utxohints.store/hints/signet\r\n```\r\n\r\nVerify the hash of the file:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\necho \"2b625392ecb2adba2b5f9d7b00c8f3a8adca0d3c  signet.hints\" | sha1sum --check -\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild the branch:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncmake -B build && cmake --build build -j $(nproc)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemove existing chain state:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrm -rf ~/.bitcoin/signet/\r\n```\r\n\r\nProvide the file at startup:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./build/bin/bitcoind --chain=signet --utxohints=./signet.hints --prune=550\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Open Questions\r\n\r\n- Given the outcome of SwiftSync is pass/fail, and there is no use of intermediate states, should blocks be persisted to disk at all during the protocol?\r\n- To what degree should a hints file be committed to in the binary. No commitment allows for a server to provide hints for an arbitrary height, providing a convenience for the client, but opens up the possibility of a grief attack. Of course the server risks losing reputation for serving faulty files.\r\n\r\n# Future Iteration\r\n\r\nThis is the first iteration of the SwiftSync proposal, however more optimizations may be made. Namely, because set elements may be added or subtracted from the aggregate in any order, blocks may be downloaded in parallel from multiple peers. If you are interested in benchmarking the performance of a fully-parallel version, see the [Rust implementation](https://github.com/2140-dev/swiftsync).\r\n",

This replaces the `-loglevel` option, which had different syntax and had to be combined with `-debug` to take effect.\r\n - The logging RPC gains trace support: a new trace parameter enables trace-level logging per category, and the output now distinguishes excluded/debug/trace categories. (`-deprecatedrpc=logging` preserves the old format.)\r\n\r\nFor developers:\r\n\r\n  - `STDLOCK()` macro for `StdMutex`, enabling clang thread-safety analysis to catch annotation gaps.\r\n  - `util::log::NO_RATE_LIMIT` lets you write LogInfo(util::log::NO_RATE_LIMIT, \"...\") instead of using the internal `LogPrintLevel` function.\r\n  - Cleaner internals: `LogPrintLevel` moves to a `detail_` namespace, `GetLogCategory` moves into `Logger`, and more\r\n  files switch from `logging.h` to the lighter `util/log.h` (continuing the separation started in #34465).",

      "body": "Builds on top of #34023, part of #30289.\r\n\r\nThis introduces a more accurate cost model for SFL, to control how much CPU time is spent inside the algorithm for clusters that cannot be linearized perfectly within a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\nThe goal is having a metric for the amount of work performed, so that txmempool can impose limits on that work: a lower bound that is always performed (unless optimality is reached before that point, of course), and an upper bound to limit the latency and total CPU time spent on this. There are conflicting design goals here:\r\n* On the one hand, it seems ideal if this metric is closely correlated to actual CPU time, because otherwise the limits become inaccurate.\r\n* On the other hand, it seems a nightmare to have the metric be platform/system dependent, as it makes network-wide reasoning nearly impossible. It's expected that slower systems take longer to do the same thing; this holds for everything, and we don't need to compensate for this.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple solutions to this:\r\n* One extreme is just measuring the time. This is very accurate, but extremely platform dependent, and also non-deterministic due to random scheduling/cache effects.\r\n* The other extreme is using a very abstract metric like counting how many times certain loops/function inside the algorithm run. That is what is implemented as of #32545 and #34023, just counting the sum of the numbers of transactions updated across all `UpdateChunks()` calls. It however necessarily fails to account for significant portions of runtime spent elsewhere, resulting in a rather wide range of \"ns per cost\" values.\r\n* This PR takes a middle ground, counting many function calls / branches / loops, with weights that were determined through benchmarking on an average on a number of systems.\r\n",

      "title": "mining: add cooldown to createNewBlock() immediately after IBD",
      "body": "_Based on #34568, which contains a breaking interface change this PR needs._\r\n\r\nAs reported in #33994, connected mining clients will receive a flood of new templates if the node is still going through IBD or catching up on the last 24 hours. This PR fixes that using an _optional_ cooldown mechanism, only applied to `createNewBlock()`.\r\n\r\nFirst, cooldown waits for IBD. Then, as the tip keeps moving forward, it waits a few seconds to see if the tip updated. If so, it restarts the timer and waits again. The trade-offs for this mechanism are explained below.\r\n\r\nBecause this PR changes `createNewBlock()` from a method that returns quickly to one that can block for minutes, we rely on #34568 to fix a bug in our `.capnp` definition, adding the missing `context` to `createNewBlock` (and `checkBlock`).\r\n\r\nThe second commit then adds an `interrupt()` method so that clients can cleanly disconnect.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThe cooldown argument is optional, and not used by internal non-IPC code, for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The mechanism wreaks havoc on the functional test suite, which would require very careful mock time handling to work around. But that's pointless, because only IPC clients need it.\r\n2. It needs to be optional for IPC clients too, because in some situations, like a signet with only one miner, waiting for IBD can mean being stuck forever.\r\n\r\nThe reason it's only applied to `createNewBlock()` is that this is the first method called by clients; `waitNext()` is a method on the interface returned by `createNewBlock()`, at which point the cooldown is done.\r\n\r\nAfter IBD, we wait N seconds if the header is N blocks ahead of the tip, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 20 seconds. The minimum waiting time is short enough that it shouldn't be annoying or confusing for someone manually starting up a client. While the maximum should be harmless if it happens spuriously (which it shouldn't).\r\n\r\nIf the minimum wait is too short, clients get a burst of templates, as observed in the original issue. We can't entirely rule this out without a lot of additional complexity (like scanning our own log file for heuristics). This PR should make it a lot less likely, and thanks to the IBD wait also limit it to one day worth of blocks (`-maxtipage`).\r\n\r\nSome test runs on an M4 MacBook Pro, where I had a node catch up on the last few days worth of blocks:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"872\" height=\"972\" alt=\"Scherm­afbeelding 2026-02-04 om 18 21 17\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7902a0f2-0e0b-4604-9688-cec2da073261\" />\r\n\r\nAs the chart shows, sometimes it takes longer than 3 seconds. But it turns out that in all those cases there were quite a few headers ahead of the tip. It also demonstrates that it's important to first wait for IBD, because it's less likely a random tip update takes longer than 20 seconds.\r\n\r\n- modified sv2-apps: https://github.com/Sjors/sv2-apps/tree/2026/02/cooldown\r\n- test script: https://gist.github.com/Sjors/feb6122c97acc2b9e6d66b168614609c#file-run_mainnet_pool_loop-zsh\r\n- chart script: https://gist.github.com/Sjors/feb6122c97acc2b9e6d66b168614609c#file-tip_interval_charts-py",

      "body": "Fixes #26527\r\n\r\nThe Bitcoin Core wallet implements an anti-fee-sniping mechanism that sets a transaction's nLockTime to the current block height, and occasionally to an earlier height.\r\n\r\nPreviously, when creating a transaction, the wallet could choose an nLockTime that was lower than the nLockTime of one of its inputs. This creates an unrealistic \"transaction signed earlier but only broadcast now\" scenario and may act as a wallet fingerprint.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by adding a `min_allowed_locktime` parameter to `DiscourageFeeSniping`. When creating a transaction, the wallet now sets this minimum to the highest locktime among all parent transactions. This ensures that while the locktime can still be backdated for anti-fee-sniping, it won't go below any input's locktime.\r\n\r\n`DiscourageFeeSniping` is invoked by the following RPCs:\r\n- `sendall`\r\n- `send`\r\n- `sendtoaddress`\r\n- `sendmany`\r\n- `fundrawtransaction`\r\n- `walletcreatefundedpsbt`\r\n\r\nTests are added for `sendall`, `send`, `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany`.\r\n\r\n`fundrawtransaction` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt` can't hit this edge case, because they don't use the anti-fee-sniping logic and instead always set nLockTime to 0 unless explicitly provided by the user.",

      "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nRegenerating the Qt translation template (`src/qt/locale/bitcoin_en.xlf`) previously used sequential `_msg<N>` IDs. When strings moved within the sorted message list, IDs shifted, creating large diffs and making translation platforms treat unchanged strings as new.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches XLF `<trans-unit id=...>` values to stable IDs derived from a SHA256 hash of the message context and source text.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33224#issuecomment-3234820665, any change that moves a translatable string within the sorted messages can renumber subsequent entries when IDs are sequential.\r\n\r\nSome English texts can appear in multiple places (e.g. “Clear”) with different meanings depending on the Qt context. To avoid collisions, the hash includes the `<group resname=...>` context.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nThe `translate` target already runs `contrib/devtools/stabilize_xlf_ids.py`. Instead of trying to preserve/renumber `_msg<N>` IDs by matching old/new units, the script now rewrites every `<trans-unit id>` to:\r\n\r\n- `sha256(resname + \"\\0\" + source-text)` (hex)\r\n- keeping the existing plural `[N]` suffix for plural forms\r\n\r\nThe script also checks for duplicate IDs and aborts if any are detected.\r\n\r\nNote: this is a one-time mass change from `_msg<N>` IDs to hashes; after that, rerunning `translate` on an unchanged tree should not churn IDs.\r\n\r\nWith this PR applied, IDs become stable hashes so ordering changes no longer cause renumbering churn.\r\n\r\n### Reproducer\r\n\r\nYou can test the replacer by changing any translatable text:\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp b/src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp\r\n--- a/src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp\t(revision a38b8cf788922174538161cda81ce28f2ac462ec)\r\n+++ b/src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp\t(date 1767310724675)\r\n@@ -258,7 +258,7 @@\r\n     connect(modalOverlay, &ModalOverlay::triggered, tabGroup, &QActionGroup::setEnabled);\r\n \r\n     overviewAction = new QAction(platformStyle->SingleColorIcon(\":/icons/overview\"), tr(\"&Overview\"), this);\r\n-    overviewAction->setStatusTip(tr(\"Show general overview of wallet\"));\r\n+    overviewAction->setStatusTip(tr(\"Show general overview of Wallet\"));\r\n     overviewAction->setToolTip(overviewAction->statusTip());\r\n     overviewAction->setCheckable(true);\r\n     overviewAction->setShortcut(QKeySequence(QStringLiteral(\"Alt+1\")));\r\n```\r\nand regenerating the translations\r\n```bash\r\ncmake --preset dev-mode -DWITH_USDT=OFF && cmake --build build_dev_mode --target translate\r\n```\r\nYou will notice that the new text moved to a different place with a different hash, but all other messages retained their IDs.",

      "body": "This drops our dependency on `boost::signals2`, leaving `boost::multi_index` as the only remaining boost dependency for bitcoind.\r\n\r\n`boost::signals2` is a complex beast, but we only use a small portion of it. Namely: it's a way for multiple subscribers to connect to the same event, and the ability to later disconnect individual subscribers from that event.\r\n\r\n`btcsignals` adheres to the subset of the `boost::signals2` API that we currently use, and thus is a drop-in replacement. Rather than implementing a complex `slot` tracking class that we never used anyway (and which was much more useful in the days before std::function existed), callbacks are simply wrapped directly in `std::function`s.\r\n\r\nThe new tests work with either `boost::signals2` or the new `btcsignals` implementation. Reviewers can verify\r\nfunctional equivalency by running the tests in the commit that introduces them against `boost::signals2`, then again with `btcsignals`.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the commits in this PR are preparation and cleanup. Once `boost::signals2` is no longer needed, it is removed from depends. Additionally, a few CMake targets no longer need boost includes as they were previously only required for signals.\r\n\r\nI think this is actually pretty straightforward to review. I kept things simple, including keeping types unmovable/uncopyable where possible rather than trying to define those semantics. In doing so, the new implementation has even fewer type requirements than boost, which I believe is due to a boost bug. I've opened a PR upstream for that to attempt to maintain parity between the implementations.\r\n\r\nSee individual commits for more details.\r\n\r\nCloses #26442.",

      "title": "refactor: extract BlockDownloadManager from PeerManagerImpl",
      "body": "### Motivation\r\n\r\n`net_processing.cpp` is the largest file in the codebase (~6200 lines) and `PeerManagerImpl` mixes several largely independent subsystems into a single class: transaction relay, address gossip, headers sync, compactblocks, and block download. This makes the file difficult to review, test in isolation, and reason about lock ordering.\r\n\r\n #30110 successfully extracted transaction download logic into `TxDownloadManager`. This PR applies the same approach to block download, continuing the incremental decomposition of `PeerManagerImpl`.\r\n \r\n### What this PR does\r\n\r\nExtract all block download state and scheduling logic into a new `BlockDownloadManager` module:\r\n\r\n**Global state moved** (from `PeerManagerImpl`): `mapBlocksInFlight`, `mapBlockSource`, `nSyncStarted`, `m_block_stalling_timeout`, `m_last_tip_update`, `m_num_preferred_download_peers`, `m_peers_downloading_from`.\r\n\r\n**Per-peer state moved** (from `CNodeState`): `pindexBestKnownBlock`, `hashLastUnknownBlock`, `pindexLastCommonBlock`, `pindexBestHeaderSent`, `fSyncStarted`, `vBlocksInFlight`, `m_downloading_since`, `m_stalling_since`, `fPreferredDownload`.\r\n\r\n**Methods moved** (from `PeerManagerImpl`): `FindNextBlocksToDownload`, `TryDownloadingHistoricalBlocks`, `ProcessBlockAvailability`, `UpdateBlockAvailability`, `BlockRequested`, `RemoveBlockRequest`, `IsBlockRequested`, `IsBlockRequestedFromOutbound`, `TipMayBeStale`.\r\n\r\n### The result:\r\n* `net_processing.cpp` shrinks from 6193 to 5751 lines (−442 net)\r\n* `CNodeState` loses 10 fields, retaining only compact block relay and chain sync timeout state\r\n* Block download logic becomes unit-testable in isolation (8 test cases added)\r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\nFollows the `TxDownloadManager` pimpl pattern:\r\n* `blockdownloadman.h` — public interface\r\n* `blockdownloadman_impl.h` — implementation class with per-peer state\r\n* `blockdownloadman_impl.cpp` — implementation\r\n\r\n Unlike `TxDownloadManager`, no new mutex is introduced. Block download is inherently tied to chain state through `CBlockIndex*` pointers, so `cs_main` remains the synchronizing lock. The extraction is for code organization and testability, not lock granularity.\r\n \r\n ### Commits\r\n\r\n1. **Add BlockDownloadManager class with pimpl skeleton**: all new module files, no call sites changed\r\n2. **Add unit tests**: exercises the module in isolation\r\n3. **Migrate call sites**: ~150 call sites in `net_processing.cpp` rewired through `m_blockdownloadman`, pure mechanical replacement",

Unfortunately, I can not recall who was mentioned as a potential user but I would appreciate if someone could ping them to take a look if this is still relevant to them.\r\n\r\nThis PR leverages the existing prune locks system we already have. The interface of the RPCs of the old PR has been slightly updated, it now matches the pattern used by `setban`/`listbanned` exactly. The locks are prefixed to distinguish them from the systems locks and prevent naming colissions. They are not persisted across restarts.\r\n\r\nUsage of temporary prune locking may also be helpful in other functional test scenarios but I didn't spend time to check where might apply.",

This wasn't included in the original PR due to the behavior change this introduces.\r\n\r\n2) Decouple `HasReason` from the unit test framework machinery\r\nThis avoids providing the entire unit test framework dependency to low-level tests that only require access to the `HasReason` utility class. Examples are: `reverlock_tests.cpp`, `sync_tests.cpp`, `util_check_tests.cpp`, `util_string_tests.cpp`, `script_parse_tests.cpp` and `threadpool_tests.cpp`. These tests no longer gain access to unnecessary components like the chainstate, node context, caches, etc. It includes @l0rinc's `threadpool_tests.cpp` `HasReason` changes.\r\n\r\n3) Include response body in non-JSON HTTP error messages\r\nStraight from @pinheadmz [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33689#discussion_r2783817192), it makes debugging CI issues easier.",

I cannot say the same for myself and my family, but it is an **honor** to receive so much personal recognition for my impact on Bitcoin Core's decision-making process and p2p code.\r\n\r\nI have deep respect for the skill of capturing people’s attentions/emotions.

This timestamp already exists internally and is used for stale-tip eviction logic; this PR exposes it at the RPC layer.\r\n\r\nThis PR started out as a suggestion for additional test coverage, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26172#issuecomment-1259678260. It turned out that the easiest way to test (already-merged) #26172 is to add this field to `getpeerinfo` and have a functional test verify its value. But it may also be useful to have this result in its own right, similar to that RPC's existing `last_block` field -- it indicates something about the quality of our peers. It allows one to predict which peer will be evicted when the stale tip logic activates. (I'm not sure if that would be useful, but it may be.)\r\n\r\nThe functional test added here fails without #26172, which is the main goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not test the actual stale-tip eviction logic; that's difficult to do with a functional test. But it does test the correctness of the timestamp that the eviction logic depends on. #23352 is an attempt to test the eviction logic using a unit test, it's not ready to be merged yet.

      "body": "# Improve Address Decoding Error Messages\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\n`DecodeDestination` does not properly handle errors when a user inputs a valid address for the wrong network (e.g., a testnet address while running the client on mainnet).\r\n\r\nThe previous error messages were misleading. For example, \"Invalid or unsupported Segwit (Bech32) or Base58 encoding\" was displayed for a valid Bech32 address on a different network. This occurred because the `is_bech32` variable only checked if the prefix matched the current network's HRP. If it didn't match, the code would fall through to Base58 decoding logic regardless of whether the string was actually a valid Bech32 address.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n### Implementation Approach\r\n\r\n1. **Decode first, then validate**: Instead of checking the prefix before decoding, we now decode the string using `bech32::Decode(str)` upfront. This takes minimal CPU cycles and is acceptable since address validation is not a frequent operation.\r\n\r\n2. **Gather decoding information**: After Bech32 decoding, we also attempt `DecodeBase58` (with a length of 100) and `DecodeBase58Check`. This provides enough information to properly diagnose errors.\r\n\r\n3. **Provide network-aware error messages**: When an address has an invalid prefix, the error message now includes the expected network values.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\n#### 1. Add Base58 Encoded Prefixes to ChainParams (`src/kernel/chainparams.cpp`, `src/kernel/chainparams.h`)\r\n\r\n#### 2. Refactor Address Decoding Logic (`src/key_io.cpp`)\r\n\r\n- Decode Bech32 upfront using `bech32::Decode(str)` instead of checking prefix first\r\n- Use structured bindings for cleaner code: `auto [bech32_encoding, bech32_hrp, bech32_chars] = bech32::Decode(str)`\r\n- Improved error handling flow with clearer branching\r\n\r\n#### 3. Improved Error Messages\r\n\r\n| Scenario | Previous Error | New Error |\r\n|----------|---------------|-----------|\r\n| Base58 address with wrong prefix | \"Invalid or unsupported Base58-encoded address.\" | \"Invalid Base58 address. Expected prefix 3, or 1\" |\r\n| Bech32 address with wrong HRP | \"Invalid or unsupported Segwit (Bech32) or Base58 encoding.\" | \"Invalid or unsupported prefix for Segwit (Bech32) address (expected bc, got tb)\" |\r\n| Invalid Base58 checksum | \"Invalid or unsupported Segwit (Bech32) or Base58 encoding.\" | \"Invalid checksum or length of Base58 address (P2PKH or P2SH)\" |\r\n| Ambiguous invalid address | \"Invalid or unsupported Segwit (Bech32) or Base58 encoding.\" | \"Address is not valid Base58 or Bech32\" |\r\n| Bech32 with checksum error | N/A | \"Bech32 address decoded with error: Invalid Bech32 checksum\" |\r\n\r\n#### 4. Test Updates\r\n\r\n- Added `test/functional/data/rpc_validateaddress.json` with comprehensive test vectors for both mainnet and signet\r\n- Updated `test/functional/rpc_validateaddress.py` to use data-driven testing across multiple networks\r\n- Updated `test/functional/rpc_invalid_address_message.py` with new error message expectations\r\n\r\n### Consistency Improvements\r\n\r\n- Removed inconsistent periods at the end of some error messages\r\n- Changed \"Bech32 v0\" to \"SegWit v0\" for clarity\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\n\r\n- Issue: #26290\r\n",

      "body": "This PR slightly modifies the `dumptxoutset` RPC to allow writing the UTXO set dump into a [named pipe](https://askubuntu.com/a/449192), so that the output data can be consumed by another process, see #31373. Taking use of this with the utxo-to-sqlite.py tool (introduced in #27432), creating an UTXO set in SQLite3 format is possible on the fly and becomes a one-liner with a newly introduced script `dump_to_sqlite.sh`. E.g. for signet:\r\n```\r\n$ ./contrib/utxo-tools/dump_to_sqlite.sh \"./build/src/bitcoin-cli -signet\" ~/utxos.sqlite3\r\nUTXO Snapshot for Signet at block hash 000000ddc3b251483cf1ebb23e2750ba..., contains 5705634 coins\r\n1048576 coins converted [18.38%], 4.474s passed since start\r\n2097152 coins converted [36.76%], 8.793s passed since start\r\n3145728 coins converted [55.13%], 13.146s passed since start\r\n4194304 coins converted [73.51%], 17.478s passed since start\r\n5242880 coins converted [91.89%], 21.832s passed since start\r\n{\r\n  \"coins_written\": 5705634,\r\n  \"base_hash\": \"000000ddc3b251483cf1ebb23e2750ba2490701d0c547241b247a9beb85498d0\",\r\n  \"base_height\": 227678,\r\n  \"path\": \"/tmp/tmp.MFHEVqetv0/utxos.fifo\",\r\n  \"txoutset_hash\": \"f29e524c999487cbd0cfca5201dce67c2c5e5c5eb115c63ad48c2239f23eea4c\",\r\n  \"nchaintx\": 8272649\r\n}\r\nTOTAL: 5705634 coins written to /home/thestack/utxos.sqlite3, snapshot height is 227678.\r\n```\r\nNote that the `dumptxoutset` RPC calculates an UTXO set hash as a first step before any data is emitted, so especially on mainnet it takes quite a while until the conversion starts and something is happening visibly.\r\n\r\nThe new script is quite minimal and PoC-y at this point, there are some potential improvement ideas:\r\n- better error handling (e.g. detect if bitcoin-cli exists, clean up tmpdir if bitcoin-cli execution fails etc.)\r\n- allow to pass through the rollback option (now we always dump at the current height, i.e. \"latest\" parameter)",

Generate build files with `-DENABLE_WAIT_FOR_DEBUGGER=ON` & build.\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_WAIT_FOR_DEBUGGER=ON && cmake --build build -j$(nproc)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2.

      "body": "This change is part of [[IBD] - Tracking PR for speeding up Initial Block Download](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32043)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is drafted until I remeasure everything after the recent merges and I need to find a way to simplify the 1 byte writes more nicely, I don't like all the specializations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR contain a few different optimization I found by IBD profiling, and via the newly added block seralization benchmarks. It also takes advantage of the recently merged [`std::span` changes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31519) enabling propagating static extents.\r\n\r\nThe commits merge similar (de)serialization methods, and separates them internally with  `if constexpr` - similarly to how it has been [done here before](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28203). This enabled further `SizeComputer` optimizations as well.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nOther than these, since single byte writes are used very often (used for every `(u)int8_t` or `std::byte` or `bool` and for every `VarInt`'s first byte which is also needed for every `(pre)Vector`), it makes sense to avoid the generalized serialization infrastructure that isn't needed:\r\n* `AutoFile` write doesn't need to allocate 4k buffer for a single byte now;\r\n* `VectorWriter` and `DataStream` avoids memcpy/insert calls;\r\n* `CSHA256::Write` can avoid `memcpy`.\r\n\r\n`DeserializeBlock` is dominated by the hash calculations so the optimizations barely affect it.\r\n\r\n### Measurements\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>C compiler ............................

      "title": "kernel: Separate UTXO set access from validation functions",
      "body": "The current code makes it hard to call functions for checking the consensus-correctness of a block without having a full UTXO set at hand. This makes implementing features such as Utreexo and non-assumevalid swiftsync, where maintaining a full UTXO set defeats their purpose, through the kernel API difficult. Checks like the coinbase subsidy, or block sigops are only available through `ConnectBlock`, which requires a complete coins cache.\r\n\r\nSolve this by moving accessing coins and the responsibility of spending them out of `ConnectBlock` and into a new separate function called `SpendBlock`. Pass a block's spent coins through the existing `CBlockUndo` data structure to `ConnectBlock`. \r\n\r\nWhile the change is largely a refactor, some smaller behaviour changes were unavoidable. These should be highlighted in the commit messages. The last commit contains the most important part of the coins logic move, the commits before attempt to prepare it piecemeal.\r\n\r\nThis pull request was benchmarked on [benchcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-tools/benchcoin/pull/162), which showed no performance regression. While discussing this pull request it was noted that pre-fetching and eliminating the need for some additional map lookups might improve performance a bit, but this does not make a measurable difference in the grand scheme of things and was not the motivation for this pull request.\r\n\r\nIn future changes, ConnectBlock could be made even more self contained, accessing the coins from the internal map could be further optimized by consolidating existence checking and spending, and the function eventually exposed in an external kernel API (as done [here](https://github.com/sedited/bitcoin/commit/09e05493010119fc60d310d3e7ffc388de441f9a#diff-f638e65d9278276b2a6ac42ffbbd26d079c3dba752feed5038a25a1ee565d320R947))",

      "body": "Before this change the code used to count references to `CNode` objects manually via `CNode::nRefCount`. Unneeded `CNode`s were scheduled for deletion by putting them in `CConnman::m_nodes_disconnected` and were deleted after their reference count reached zero. Deleting consists of calling `PeerManager::FinalizeNode()` and destroying the `CNode` object.\r\n\r\nReplace this scheme with `std::shared_ptr`. This simplifies the code and removes:\r\n`CNode::nRefCount`\r\n`CNode::GetRefCount()`\r\n`CNode::AddRef()`\r\n`CNode::Release()`\r\n`CConnman::m_nodes_disconnected`\r\n`CConnman::NodesSnapshot`\r\n\r\nNow creating a snapshot of `CConnman::m_nodes` is done by simply copying it (under the mutex).\r\n\r\nCall `PeerManager::FinalizeNode()` from the destructor of `CNode`, which is called when the reference count reaches 0.\r\n\r\nThis removes brittle code and replaces it by a code from the standard library which is more robust. All the below are possible with the manual reference counting and not possible with `shared_ptr`:\r\n* Use an object without adding a reference to it\r\n* Add too many references to an object, mismatch the add/remove by having more \"add\"\r\n* Forget to reduce the reference count, mismatch the add/remove by having less \"remove\"\r\n* Go with negative reference count by mistakenly having too many \"remove\"\r\n* Destroy an object while there are references to it\r\n\r\nThere is zero learning curve for the average C++ programmer who knows how `shared_ptr` works. Not so much with the manual reference counting because one has to learn about `AddRef()`, `Release()`, check and maintain where are they called and their relationship with `m_nodes_disconnected`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis has some history in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28222 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10738.

      "body": "For Stratum v2 custom job declaration to be bandwidth efficient, the pool can request[^0] only the transactions that it doesn't know about.\r\n\r\nThe spec doesn't specify how this is achieved, but one method is to call the `getrawtransaction` RPC on each transaction id listed in [DeclareMiningJob](https://stratumprotocol.org/specification/06-Job-Declaration-Protocol?query=DeclareMiningJob#644-declareminingjob-client-server) (or a subset if the pool software maintains a cache). Using RPC is inefficient, made worse by the need to make multiple calls. It also doesn't support queuing by witness id (yet, see #34013).\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two new IPC methods:\r\n\r\n- `getTransactions()`: takes a list of `Txid`'s\r\n- `getTransactionsByWitnessID()`: : takes a list of `Wtxid`'s\r\n\r\nBoth return a list of serialised transactions. An empty element is returned for transactions that were not found.\r\n\r\nThe `Txid` variant, just like its RPC counterpart, takes advantage of `-txindex` if enabled. The `Wtxid` variant can't do that unless we add a `-witnesstxindex`, but at least sv2 has no use for that.\r\n\r\nThe RPC additionally allows providing a `block_hash` hint. I haven't implemented that here because I don't have a need or it. It can always be added later.\r\n\r\nI thought about having a single (or overloaded) `getTransactions()` that works with both `Txid` and `Wtxid`, but I prefer that clients are intentional about which one they want.\r\n\r\nA unit and functional test cover the new functionality.\r\n\r\nSv2 probably only needs `getTransactionsByWitnessID()`, but it's easy enough to just add both.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] figure out https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/issues/235 (this PR is draft pending that, subtree linter failure is expected)\r\n\r\n[^0]: there's two reasons the pool requests these transactions: to approve the template and to broadcast the block if a solution is found (the miner will also broadcast via their template provider).

      "body": "# Add UTXO Snapshot Loading Interface and Progress Notifications\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a complete interface for loading UTXO snapshots through the GUI, including progress notifications to provide user feedback during the loading process.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### Commit 1: `interfaces: expose UTXO snapshot loading in node interface`\r\n\r\n- Added a new virtual method `loadSnapshot` to the node interface for loading UTXO snapshots.\r\n- Updated the implementation in `interfaces.cpp` to activate the snapshot using the provided file and metadata.\r\n- This change enhances the user's ability to load UTXO snapshots through the GUI.\r\n\r\n### Commit 2: `notifications: Implement snapshot load progress notifications`\r\n\r\n- Added a new signal `SnapshotLoadProgress` for snapshot load progress in the UI interface.\r\n- Updated the notifications interface to include a method for reporting snapshot loading progress.\r\n- Enhanced the `ChainstateManager` to report progress during snapshot loading.\r\n- Implemented the necessary handler in the kernel notifications to relay progress updates.\r\n- This change improves user feedback during the snapshot loading process.\r\n\r\n### Commit 3: `rpc: refactor loadtxoutset to use snapshot interface`\r\n\r\n- Updated the loadtxoutset RPC to call the new snapshot interface instead of directly working with chainstate internals.\r\n- Added getMetadata and getActivationResult methods to the snapshot interface to provide parity with the legacy RPC.\r\n- Improves modularity by consolidating snapshot handling through the interface layer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n\r\nThe implementation includes:\r\n\r\n- **UI Interface Enhancement**\r\n  Added `SnapshotLoadProgress` signal to `CClientUIInterface` with corresponding signal declaration and implementation.\r\n\r\n- **Node Interface**\r\n  Added `loadSnapshot` virtual method to the node interface with implementation in `interfaces.cpp`.\r\n\r\n- **Progress Notifications**\r\n  Implemented `snapshotLoadProgress` method in `KernelNotifications` class to relay progress updates to the UI.\r\n\r\n- **Base Interface**\r\n  Added `snapshotLoadProgress` virtual method to the kernel notifications interface.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n- **User Experience**\r\n  Provides real-time feedback during UTXO snapshot loading operations.\r\n\r\n- **GUI Integration**\r\n  Enables loading UTXO snapshots directly through the Bitcoin Core GUI.\r\n\r\n- **Progress Tracking**\r\n  Users can monitor the progress of snapshot loading operations.\r\n\r\n- **Consistent Interface**\r\n  Follows the existing pattern for progress notifications in the codebase.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- **Daemon** build and launch `bitcoind` then with `bitcoin-cli` load a snapshot using:\r\n```bash\r\n./bitcoin-cli -rpcclienttimeout=0 -signet loadtxoutset /path/to/utxo-snapsshot.dat\r\n```\r\n- **QT Widgets**: build and run [this](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/870) draft PR in legacy gui repo \r\n- **QML** version: for a modern look build and run [this](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml/pull/488) PR in the newly updated gui-qml repo \r\n",

      "body": "The current test has a couple issues:\r\n\r\n1) the parent_tx_good is regenerating the exact same transaction that is already in the cluster, so it's resulting in no replacements on submission\r\n2) once fixed, the additional fee needs to be allocated to the parent transaction in the package, not the child. If the RBF fees are allocated to the child, this triggers the package RBF logic, which requires no in-mempool ancestors to be present.\r\n\r\nFix the bug and add a few assertions to protect against regressions.\r\n\r\n",

      "title": "blocks: add `-reobfuscate-blocks` argument to enable (de)obfuscating existing blocks",
      "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nRecent discussions highlighted that many nodes which synced before Bitcoin Core v28 have their block and undo files stored effectively in the clear (zero XOR key). This patch adds a simple, resumable maintenance tool to obfuscate previously raw block files, rotate an existing key to a fresh random one, or de-obfuscate (set key to zero) if consciously chosen, all without requiring resync. The operation can be cancelled and restarted safely.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nThe new startup option `-reobfuscate-blocks[=VALUE]` accepts either 16 hex characters as an exact 8-byte XOR key (little-endian in-memory layout) or a boolean to generate a random 64-bit key. e.g. `-reobfuscate-blocks=0000000000000000` sets the key to zero, effectively removing obfuscation.\r\n\r\nIf we detect unobfuscated blocks at start time we suggest this new option in a warning.\r\n\r\nAt startup, we iterate over all undo and block files (grouping the block and undo files for more uniform iteration), read them with the old XOR key and write them back with the new key (`<name>.reobfuscated`). The implementation actually combines the two keys and reads directly into the new obfuscated version to only do a single iteration over the data. This works if the original blocks aren't obfuscated or if the new blocks aren't or if both are.\r\nAfter successful write, we immediately delete the old file. Once all files are staged, we rename them back and atomically swap `xor.dat.reobfuscated` → `xor.dat` and continue operation.\r\n\r\nWe log the old and new keys and print progress roughly per-percent as files complete (i.e. max 100 progress logs).\r\n\r\n### Constraints\r\n\r\n* Re-obfuscation resumes automatically (detected via `xor.dat.reobfuscated`) even without the flag. In worst-case a crash should only force us to redo previous work.\r\n* Single-threaded, processing one file at a time to keep code simple and avoid complexity of interleaving renames and key swaps across threads.\r\n* Fast in practice with sequential read/modify/write per blockfile - after recent obfuscation vectorization, this path is very quick.\r\n\r\n### Reproducer\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncmake -B build -DBUILD_GUI=ON && cmake --build build -j$(nproc)\r\n# command line\r\n./build/bin/bitcoind -reobfuscate-blocks -stopatheight=1\r\n# same with GUI\r\n./build/bin/bitcoin-qt -reobfuscate-blocks -stopatheight=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Single-threaded Performance\r\n\r\n cpu                 | hdd/ssd | block count | size    | files  | time (min) | blocks/min \r\n---------------------|---------|-------------|---------|--------|------------|------------\r\n Apple M4 Max laptop | SSD     | ~909k       | ~707 GB | 9,982  | 8.4        | 146,613    \r\n Intel Core i9       | SSD     | ~909k       | ~725 GB | 10,238 | 23.1       | 39,351     \r\n Raspberry Pi 5      | SSD     | ~914k       | ~728 GB | 10,276 | 72.78      | 12,558     \r\n Intel Core i7       | HDD     | ~909k       | ~720 GB | 10,156 | 208.7      | 4,356      \r\n Raspberry Pi 4B     | HDD     | ~915k       | ~730 GB | 10,304 | 1467       | 624        \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSimilar work:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32451\r\n* https://github.com/andrewtoth/blocks-xor\r\n",

      "body": "This PR implements the first step of #33758 by adding a cache layer for node block templates.\r\n\r\nThe cache stores newly created block templates along with their configuration options. When clients request a block template, they specify an optional template age limit in `MillisecondsDouble`:\r\n\r\n- If template age limit is `nullopt`, we create a new template and return it without adding it to the cache.\r\n- If a matching template (block template with identical block creation options) exists in the cache and hasn't exceeded the age limit, the cached version is returned.\r\n- If no matching template exists or the age limit has been exceeded, a new template is generated, cached, and returned. When evicting stale templates, we assume no duplicates exist since templates are evicted as soon as their age limit is reached or exceeded.\r\n\r\nThe cache maintains a configurable maximum size (default: 10 templates). When this limit is exceeded, the oldest template is evicted after each insertion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCache lookup requires an exact match on ALL `BlockAssembler::Options` fields. While some fields (e.g., `test_block_validity`, `print_modified_fee`, `coinbase_output_script`) could be ignored for cache reuse, they mainly differ in tests and benchmarks. We keep the logic simple and accept cache misses in those cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cache enforces at most one template per set of options. When searching for a match in `getCachedTemplate()`, if a template with matching options is found but has exceeded the age limit, it's immediately evicted before returning `nullptr`. This ensures no duplicate options exist in the cache. A `SanityCheck()` method verifies this invariant in tests by checking all cached entries for duplicates.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cache subscribes to the validation interface and clears itself when blocks are connected (to non-historical chainstate to avoid clearing during assumeutxo background validation) or disconnected from the active chain (during reorgs), preventing stale or invalid templates from being served.\r\n\r\n`GetBlockTemplate()` uses double-checked locking: it first checks the cache with only `m_mutex` held, then if there's a miss, acquires both `cs_main` and `m_mutex` to create the template. Before creating, it checks again since another thread might have added a template while locks were released. \r\n\r\nThis PR removes an unused `node/context.h` import from miner to prevent a circular dependency when exposing the block template cache to the node context.",

      "body": "This is an alternative approach to implement `dumptxoutset` with rollback that was discussed a few times. It does not rely on `invalidateblock` and `reconsiderblock` and instead creates a temporary copy of the coins DB, modifies this copy by rolling back as many blocks as necessary and then creating the dump from this temp copy DB. See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29553#issuecomment-1978480989, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32817#issuecomment-3012406102 and #29565 discussions.\r\n\r\nThe nice side-effects of this are that forks can not interfere with the rollback and network activity does not have to be suspended. But there are also some downsides when comparing to the current approach: this does require some additional disk space for the copied coins DB and performance is slower (master took 3m 17s vs 9m 16s in my last test with the code here, rolling back ~1500 blocks). However, there is also not much code being added here, network can stay active throughout and performance would stay constant with this approach while it would impact master if there were forks that needed to be invalidated as well (see #33444 for the alternative approach), so this could still be considered a good trade-off.",

      "title": "Extend signetchallenge to set target block spacing",
      "body": "Inspired by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27446, this PR implements the proposal detailed in the comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27446#issuecomment-1516600820.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nIntroduce the ability to configure a custom target time between blocks in a custom Bitcoin signet network. This enhancement enables users to create a signet that is more conducive to testing. The change enhances the flexibility of signet, rendering it more versatile for various testing scenarios. For instance, I am currently working on setting up a signet with a 30-second block time. However, this caused numerous difficulty adjustments, resulting in an inconsistent network state. Regtest isn't a viable alternative for me in this context since we prefer defaults to utilize our custom signet when configured, without impeding local regtest development.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nIf the challenge format is `OP_RETURN PUSHDATA<params> PUSHDATA<actual challenge>`, the actual challenge from the second data push is used as the signet challenge, and the parameters from the first push are used to configure the network. Otherwise the challenge is used as is.\r\n\r\nUnder the previous rules, such a signet challenge would always evaluate to `false`, suggesting that it is likely not in use by anyone. Updating bitcoind to a version that includes this change will not cause any disruptions — existing signet challenges will retain their original meaning without alteration.\r\n\r\nThe only parameter currently available is \"target_spacing\" (default 600 seconds). To set it, place `0x01<target_spacing as uint64_t, little endian>` in the params. Empty params are also valid. If other network parameters are added in the future, they should use `0x02<option 2 value>`, `0x03<option 3 value>`, etc., following the protobuf style.\r\n\r\nTwo public functions were added to `chainparams.h`:\r\n  - `ParseWrappedSignetChallenge`: Extracts signet params and signet challenge from a wrapped signet challenge.\r\n  - `ParseSignetParams`: Parses `<params>` bytes of the first data push.\r\n\r\nFunction `ReadSigNetArgs` calls `ParseWrappedSignetChallenge` and `ParseSignetParams` to implement the new meaning of signetchallenge.\r\n\r\nThe description of the flag `-signetchallenge` was updated to reflect the changes.\r\n\r\nA new unit tests file, `chainparams_tests.cpp`, was added, containing tests for `ParseWrappedSignetChallenge` and `ParseSignetParams`.\r\n\r\nThe test `signet_parse_tests` from the file `validation_tests.cpp` was modified to ensure proper understanding of the new logic.\r\n\r\nIn the functional test `feature_signet.py`, a test case was added with the value of `-signetchallenge` set to the wrapped challenge, setting spacing to 30 seconds and having the actual challenge `OP_TRUE`.\r\n\r\nThe Signet miner was updated, introducing a new option `--target-spacing` with a default of 600 seconds. It must be set to the value used by the network.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nI tested this PR against [Mutinynet](https://blog.mutinywallet.com/mutinynet/), a signet running on a custom fork of Bitcoin Core, implementing 30s target spacing. I successfully synchronized the blockchain using the following config:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsignet=1\r\n[signet]\r\nsignetchallenge=6a4c09011e000000000000004c25512102f7561d208dd9ae99bf497273e16f389bdbd6c4742ddb8e6b216e64fa2928ad8f51ae\r\naddnode=45.79.52.207:38333\r\ndnsseed=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe content of this wrapped challenge:\r\n\r\n```\r\n6a OP_RETURN\r\n4c OP_PUSHDATA1\r\n09 (length of signet params = 9)\r\n011e00000000000000 (signet params: 0x01, pow_target_spacing=30)\r\n4c OP_PUSHDATA1\r\n25 (length of challenge = 37)\r\n512102f7561d208dd9ae99bf497273e16f389bdbd6c4742ddb8e6b216e64fa2928ad8f51ae\r\n(original Mutinynet challenge)\r\n```",

      "body": "During a reindex, the assumevalid setting may be ignored if the chainwork of the best header is below `minimumchainwork`. This happens when the previous IBD was stopped before connecting enough blocks to reach the required `minimumchainwork`. The assumevalid block will also be missing from the block index because the assumevalid block is set to match the `minimumchainwork`. See [Issue #31494](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31494).\r\n\r\nAs a result, `reindex` can take significantly longer to complete than necessary.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue by modifying reindex behaviour: if the chainwork of the `best_header` is below `minimumchainwork`, the node skips the `ActivateBestChain()` step and proceeds directly to synchronisation.\r\n\r\nThis PR takes a different approach from [PR #31615](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31615) to keep the validation path for `reindex` the same as the regular IBD validation path.\r\n\r\nDevelopers benchmarking IBD with `-reindex` may find this behaviour undesirable. In such cases, it’s recommended to use `-reindex-chainstate` instead or ensure that the available blocks have sufficient chainwork.\r\n\r\n`libbitcoinkernel` exposes the `ImportBlocks` function and expects `reindex` to connect blocks, so an attempt was made to preserve the existing behaviour for `libbitcoinkernel`.",

Namely, `getTransactionAncestry` returns the cluster count, not max descendant count of ancestor set (not worth reimplementing as it is merely a heuristic). No behavior changes - I don’t think much needs to be changed for the first release containing cluster mempool. \r\n\r\nCurrent `CoinEligibilityFilter`s enforce a maximum ancestor count (summed across all outputs, potentially overestimating) and max descendant count across ancestors of the output.\r\n\r\nSince #33629, these filters have started using cluster count instead of max desc count across ancestors. The change isn’t dangerous, as the cluster count bounds descendant count as well. Currently, the wallet is essentially enforcing a mixture of both limits - this is good while we are transitioning. Note that the cluster count enforced is 25, not 64, since it's grabbing the node's descendant count limit. While it is not an apples-to-apples comparison, a cluster count limit of 25 helps us avoid busting legacy descendant limits (which will be common on the network for a while).\r\n\r\nPotential things for the future, out of scope for this PR:\r\n- When we get rid of the ancestor/descendant config options, `getPackageLimits` can probably be replaced with hard-coded values.\r\n- Change the `OutputGroup`s to track the actual cluster count that results from spending these outputs and merging their clusters.\r\n- Loosen from 25 after that policy is no longer common.\r\n- Clean up `getPackageLimits`.",

Since that was not predictably available on CI, those tests required a manual setting up of IP addresses (e.g. using `ifconfig`) and then running the tests with a command line option telling them that the addresses are set up. The tests were not run in CI and [got rot](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31293#issuecomment-2497792487).\r\n\r\nChange that to auto-detect, from the tests, whether the needed IP addresses are present and if yes, run the test, otherwise skip it. Also change the CI to configure the needed addresses when running the functional tests. This way the tests will be run regularly on CI.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31293\r\nFixes: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31336\r\n",

If desired, I can use the message start instead as suggested in [#29838 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29838#discussion_r1557976175).\r\n* If the default challenge is provided to `-signetchallenge`, [#29838](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29838) added a suffix to the datadir, whereas this PR does not. This includes backward compatibility when the default signet is used explicitly, not only implicitly, even though [the default signet consensus parameters aren't used in the explicit case](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29838#issuecomment-2742830552).[^1] A test was added for this case.\r\n\r\n[^1]: could be something for a follow-up PR, or maybe it's intentional to not mix explicit with implicit options?\r\n\r\nUnlike #29838, this PR does not update tests that didn't break (`rpc_bind.py`, `interface_bitcoin_cli.py`). I have found other tests where `datadir_path` is used in combination with `self.chain` (regexp: `datadir_path.*chain`). I considered it inconsistent to update some tests but not all of them. I've decided to not update all of them to keep the scope of this PR low until feedback. I can go through all tests in a follow-up PR to make sure they don't break when they are ever used with (custom) signet, however unlikely that might be.\r\n\r\nI have done some manual testing like this:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>manual testing</summary>\r\n\r\n* `bitcoind -signet`: 'signet' directory is used, IBD\r\n* `bitcoind -signet -signetchallenge=512103ad5e0edad18cb1f0fc0d28a3d4f1f3e445640337489abb10404f2d1e086be430210359ef5021964fe22d6f8e05b2463c9540ce96883fe3b278760f048f5189f2e6c452ae`: 'signet' directory is used, no IBD without `-addnode` (see [#29838 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29838#issuecomment-2742830552))\r\n* `bitcoind -conf=\"signet_default.conf\"`: 'signet' directory is used\r\n* `bitcoind -conf=\"signet_custom.conf\"`: 'signet_0014d4528367459d' directory is used\r\n* `bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo` with the same options (`-signet`, `-conf`, or `-signet -signetchallenge`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n# signet_default.conf\r\nsignet=1\r\n[signet]\r\nsignetchallenge=512103ad5e0edad18cb1f0fc0d28a3d4f1f3e445640337489abb10404f2d1e086be430210359ef5021964fe22d6f8e05b2463c9540ce96883fe3b278760f048f5189f2e6c452ae\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# signet_custom.conf\r\nsignet=1\r\n[signet]\r\nsignetchallenge=0014d4528367459d54e1545b0d0a677d2a7d71d648e0\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI'm new to contributing to Bitcoin Core so it's entirely possible that I've missed something obvious.\r\n\r\nFeedback welcome on where to best define the default signet challenge for the functional tests and the C++ code to avoid duplication.\r\n",

Whereas IPC clients do set a value which is no longer ignored.\r\n\r\nTest coverage is added, with a preliminary commit that refactors the `create_block_template` and `wait_next_template` helpers.\r\n\r\n`mining_basic.py` already ensured `-blockreservedweight` is enforced by mining RPC methods. The second commit adds coverage for Mining interface IPC clients. It also verifies that `-blockreservedweight` has no effect on them.\r\n\r\nThe third commit enforces `MINIMUM_BLOCK_RESERVED_WEIGHT` for IPC clients.

      "body": "Currently, header-only dependencies in the depends subsystem are installed into the standard `include/` subdirectory. This inadvertently exposes their headers to the compiler via `-I` flags brought in by other dependencies (e.g., `libevent` or `sqlite`). This \"include path pollution\" masks missing dependencies in the build configuration. While the build might succeed by accident due to this overlap, it creates a fragile state. If the overlapping library is removed, the build will break, or, worse, the compiler may silently fall back to the host system's default paths (e.g., `/usr/include`).\r\n\r\nThis PR improves build system security and hygiene by enforcing strict, distinguished include paths for header-only dependencies. The missing dependencies revealed by this change (`Boost::headers`, `USDT::headers`) have been fixed in separate commits.",

This issue predates #32273, because the relative pathnames get stacked together, e.g. \"../../\", the copy conflict bug that caused migration to abort early instead of getting far enough to attempt clean-up that was fixed in #32273 is avoided.\r\n\r\nThis is a functional test demonstrating that we handle failed migration clean-up correctly for relatively-named wallets. To see the issue, you can backport this test onto 29.x: https://github.com/davidgumberg/bitcoin/tree/2026-01-07-rel-migration-test-backport\r\n\r\nI've also added an absolute path failed migration cleanup test. WRT this and #34156, absolute paths exhibit similar behavior to unnamed wallets. Because of the name-conflict bug prior to #32273 an absolute-path migration would fail no matter what because migration would attempt to copy a file to a destination that already exists. But after #32273, absolute-path migration gets past there, and if it fails for some other reason, the same behavior that's fixed in #34156 occurs where the directory containing the wallet file is deleted.",

      "body": "When a wallet is automatically upgraded, we always do so in a way that allows the user to load their wallet in an older version. When the user loads their wallet into an upgraded version again, the wallet may not perform the automatic upgrade and end up with upgraded and non-upgraded material in the wallet.\r\n\r\nIf we write some information about the last client to open the wallet, we would be able to detect these upgrade-downgrade-upgrade situations and perform another upgrade if so. However, in order for this to work, we need to have implemented writing such information into versions prior to the ones which introduce new automatic upgrades.\r\n\r\nWe are already writing the CLIENT_VERSION into all wallets in a \"version\" record, although this record is not updated in the same way across all previous versions. Since v24.0, we are always updating the record when the client version differs, but prior to that, the record would only be updated when the client version is newer. Even so, we can use this record to store the last client version.\r\n\r\nThe first commit decouples the written client version from the node version. This aids in development of new features. The version is entirely decoupled from previous versions by requiring all versions to have bit 30 set, and the initial version being `0 | (1 << 30)`. The versions just need to be at least 299900, and forcing bit 30 to be set was an easy way to achieve this.\r\n\r\nHowever, using version numbers is not as flexible as feature flags, so the second commit introduces the concept of Wallet Client Features. These flags are distinct from the existing Wallet Feature Flags since they are conceptually different. These are written in a separate record, and the wallet client version is incremented to `(1 << 0) | (1 << 30)`.\r\n\r\nLastly, since some upgrades may need private keys and can only occur after the wallet is decrypted, the third commit also adds a last decrypted features flags record to record the features of the last client to decrypt the wallet.\r\n\r\nThe result is that we will now be able to detect a downgrade down to v24.0 and be able to implement in parallel multiple features that require automatic upgrades.",

      "body": "Work is currently happening on #33689.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe current procedure for building the block filter index involves processing filters one at a time;\r\nReading blocks, undo data, and previous headers from disk sequentially.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new mechanism to perform the work concurrently. Dividing the filters\r\ngeneration workload among a pool of workers that can be configured by the user,\r\nsignificantly increasing the speed of the index construction process.\r\n\r\nThe same concurrent processing model has been applied to the transactions index as well.\r\n\r\nThe newly introduced init flag `-indexworkers=<n>` enables the concurrent sync\r\nbehavior.\r\nWhere \"n\" is the number of worker threads that will be spawned at startup to create ranges\r\nof block filters during the initial sync process. Destroying the workers pool once the\r\ninitial sync completes.\r\nNote: by default, the parallelized sync process is not enabled.\r\n\r\nNow the juicy part:\r\nIn my computer, with the node in debug mode and on IBD, with `-indexworkers=4`, the\r\nblock filter index generation took less than an hour. While, in master, the sync took more than 7 hours.\r\n\r\nImportant Note:\r\nAs the access to the block data on disk is protected by `cs_main`, this new feature runs substantially\r\nfaster when the node is not in IBD.\r\n\r\n#### Testing Notes:\r\n\r\n1. Sync your node without any index.\r\n2. Restart the node with one of the indexes (`-blockfilterindex` or `-txindex`) and `-connect=0` (to sync only the index, without running the net/validation threads. Since threads won't be competing for `cs_main`, this will give you a more accurate result).\r\n\r\n   You’ll see a \"[index name] is enabled at height [height]\" log entry once it finishes. Then it’s just a matter of subtracting the index startup time from the \"index synced\" log time.\r\n\r\n  Keep in mind that threads are shared among all indexes you start. So if you run both indexes at the same time, your benchmark results cannot be compared against single-index runs.\r\n\r\n#### Fuzz Test Coverage Report\r\nCoverage diff for the fuzz test can be found on https://brunoerg.xyz/bitcoin-core-coverage/26966/coverage_report/",

      "title": "txgraph: deterministic optimal transaction order",
      "body": "Part of #30289.\r\n\r\nTxGraph's fundamental responsibility is deciding the order of transactions in the mempool. It relies on the `cluster_linearize.h` code to optimize it, but there can and often will be many different orderings that are essentially equivalent from a quality perspective, so we have to pick one. At a high level, the solution will involve one or more of:\r\n* Deciding based on **internal identifiers** (`Cluster::m_sequence`, `DepGraphIndex`). This is very simple, but risks leaking information about transaction receive order.\r\n* Deciding **randomly**, which is private, but may interfere with relay expectations, block propagation, and ability to monitor network behavior.\r\n* Deciding **based on txid**, which is private and deterministic, but risks incentivizing grinding to get an edge (though we haven't really seen such behavior).\r\n* Deciding **based on size** (e.g. prefer smaller transactions), which is somewhat related to quality, but not unconditionally (depending on mempool layout, the ideal ordering might call for smaller transactions first, last, or anywhere in between). It's also not a strong ordering as there can be many identically-sized transactions. However, if it were to encourage grinding behavior, incentivizing smaller transactions is probably not a bad thing.\r\n\r\nAs of #32545, the current behavior is primarily picking randomly, though inconsistently, as some code paths also use internal identifiers and size. #33335 sought to change it to use random (preferring size in a few places), with the downsides listed above.\r\n\r\nThis PR is an alternative to that, which changes the order to tie-break based on size everywhere possible, and use lowest-txid-first as final fallback. This is fully deterministic: for any given set of mempool transactions, if all linearized optimally, the transaction order exposed by TxGraph is deterministic.\r\n\r\nThe transactions within a chunk are sorted according to:\r\n1. `PostLinearize` (which improves sub-chunk order), using an initial linearization created using the rules 2-5 below.\r\n2. Topology (parents before children).\r\n3. Individual transaction feerate (high to low)\r\n4. Individual transaction weight (small to large)\r\n5. Txid (low to high txid)\r\n\r\nThe chunks within a cluster are sorted according to:\r\n1. Topology (chunks after their dependencies)\r\n2. Chunk feerate (high to low)\r\n3. Chunk weight (small to large)\r\n4. Max-txid (chunk with lowest maximum-txid first)\r\n\r\nThe chunks across clusters are sorted according to:\r\n1. Feerate (high to low)\r\n2. Equal-feerate-chunk-prefix weight (small to large)\r\n3. Max-txid (chunk with lowest maximum-txid first)\r\n\r\nThe equal-feerate-chunk-prefix weight of a chunk C is defined as the sum of the weights of all chunks in the same cluster as C, with the same feerate as C, up to and including C itself, in linearization order (but excluding such chunks that appear after C). This is a well-defined approximation of sorting chunks from small to large across clusters, while remaining consistent with intra-cluster linearization order.\r\n",

      "title": "[Draft/POC] Add secp256k1-based HPKE (Hybrid Public Key Encryption) For Payjoin v2",
      "body": "This PR introduces an implementation of Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) using a secp256k1-based Diffie-Hellman KEM (per RFC 9180 and \"secp256k1-based DHKEM for HPKE\" specification). It provides the core cryptographic component needed to enable the Payjoin v2 protocol.\r\n\r\nThis is an exploratory PR intended to kickstart discussion on adding Payjoin v2 support to Bitcoin Core – feedback and reviews are very welcome.\r\n\r\nPayjoin v2 makes use of a protocol called Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) to strip client-identifying metadata from the request. This protocol use a binary-encoded HTTP message encapsulated through HPKE.\r\n\r\nThe core implementation is contained in the new files `src/dhkem_secp256k1.h` and `src/dhkem_secp256k1.cpp`:\r\n\r\n* Full HPKE Modes: All four HPKE modes are supported – `Base`, `PSK`, `Auth`, and `AuthPSK`.\r\n* Secp256k1 DHKEM: Uses secp256k1 for Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The `Encap()` and `Decap()` functions perform the base mode KEM (ephemeral ECDH using the receiver’s public key), while `AuthEncap()` and `AuthDecap()` extend this to authenticated mode (including the sender’s static key in the shared secret derivation). Internally, the shared secret is derived as specified by HPKE using HKDF (SHA256) extraction and expansion.\r\n* Key Schedule & Nonce Derivation: After KEM, the implementation runs the HPKE key schedule to derive the `encryption key`, `base nonce`, and `exporter secret`. It follows RFC 9180 §7.1, hashing the `info` and `psk_id` contexts and deriving the AEAD key and nonce. Per-message nonces are computed by XOR-ing the base nonce with a message sequence number as specified in RFC 9180 §5.2.\r\n* AEAD Encryption (ChaCha20-Poly1305): The HPKE context uses `ChaCha20-Poly1305` as the authenticated encryption scheme. The code provides `Seal()` and `Open()` functions to encrypt and decrypt data using the derived context key and a given nonce. It uses Bitcoin Core’s existing ChaCha20Poly1305 implementation.\r\n\r\nThe test file validates all the functions mentioned above: Encapsulation/Decapsulation, Encryption/Decryption, Nonce and Key Schedule Logic. This uses the PDK (Payjoin Dev Kit) test vectors. The tests also show how to use the HPKE functions.\r\n\r\nThis implementation only uses HKDF-SHA256 as Key Derivation Functions and ChaCha20-Poly1305 as AEAD, since these already exist in the Bitcoin Core codebase. It does not support other KDFs (such as HKDF-SHA384 and HKDF-SHA512) or other AEADs (such as AES-128-GCM and AES-256-GCM).\r\n\r\nTo run the tests:\r\n`build/bin/test_bitcoin --log_level=all --run_test=dhkem_secp256k1_tests`",

      "body": "Take advantage of the [new secp256k1 option to avoid visibility attributes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1696) on API functions.\r\n\r\nWhile most users of a shared libsecp always want API functions exported so that they can actually be linked against, we always build it statically. When that static lib is linked into a (static or shared) libbitcoinkernel, by default its symbols end up exported there as well.\r\n\r\nAs libsecp is an implementation detail of the kernel (and any future Core lib), its symbols should never be exported.\r\n\r\n[This was the intended use for the above PR](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1696#issuecomment-3028838988), looks like we just forgot to follow-up and actually hook it up.\r\n\r\nThis is most easily tested by building with `-DBUILD_KERNEL_LIB=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` (with or without `-DREDUCE_EXPORTS=ON`) and inspecting via:\r\n```bash\r\nnm -CD lib/libbitcoinkernel.so | grep secp\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this change, secp's symbols will show up there. After, they should be absent.\r\n\r\nThis should finally solve secp symbol visibility once and for all :)",

It is disconnected but it is allowed to immediately reconnect.  Wouldn't it be possible to exploit this behaviour to make the blocks of competitors relay slowly, by just sending the inv message for them but never delivering the content.\r\n\r\nThis is with bitcoin v0.15.1\r\n",

      "title": "Bitcoin Core v29.0 incorrectly enters IBD mode when only ~600 blocks behind, preventing normal sync",
      "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nHi, I have a full node on a development machine that is not always run. It runs a self compiled none modified v29.0 node as systemd service on an Ubuntu 24.04 system. I had it twice now that the node, after not using it for a few days would go into IBD mode. This time I tried rebuilding the chain state but it would only go as far as the same block it was stuck on before. By running `bitcoin-cli -conf=/mnt/btc/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf reconsiderblock 000000000000000000009d1dd2f71099471a348f4074285707b17e0588c41002` it would synced 48 blocks to then get stuck again. Running reconsiderblock again using `bitcoin-cli -conf=/mnt/btc/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf reconsiderblock $(bitcoin-cli -conf=/mnt/btc/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf getbestblockhash)` did not trigger the sync to continue. After restarting with parameters -minimumchainwork=0 -maxtipage=31536000 it is now syncing again normally.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nShould sync normally without manual intervention\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nTurn of the PC normally and let it fall behind a few days. I cannot say how reproducible this is since it only happened twice so far and it does not happen often that the machine is not used for more than ~12 hours. With shorter times offline it seems not to happen.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\nThis is my startup log from a try where it was in IBD:\n\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc systemd[1]: Starting bitcoind.service - Bitcoin Daemon...\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Bitcoin Core version v29.0 (release build)\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Using the 'x86_shani(1way,2way)' SHA256 implementation\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Using RdSeed as an additional entropy source\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Using RdRand as an additional entropy source\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Default data directory /nonexistent/.bitcoin\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Using data directory /mnt/btc/.bitcoin\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file: /mnt/btc/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: bind=\"0.0.0.0\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: checkblocks=\"24\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: checklevel=\"0\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: dbcache=\"8000\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: listen=\"1\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: maxconnections=\"24\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: port=\"8333\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: rpcallowip=\"192.168.1.0/24\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: rpcbind=\"0.0.0.0\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: rpcpassword=****\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: rpcport=\"8332\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: rpcuser=****\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: server=\"1\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config file arg: txindex=\"1\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Setting file arg: wallet = [\"cormorant\"]\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Command-line arg: conf=\"/mnt/btc/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Command-line arg: datadir=\"/mnt/btc/.bitcoin\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Command-line arg: startupnotify=\"systemd-notify --ready\"\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Using at most 24 automatic connections (65535 file descriptors available)\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z scheduler thread start\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Binding RPC on address 0.0.0.0 port 8332\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z WARNING: the RPC server is not safe to expose to untrusted networks such as the public internet\nJul 12 10:48:31 linuxpc bitcoind[335661]: 2025-07-12T13:48:31Z Config options rpcuser and rpcpassword will soon be deprecated.

Now we have split these two cases to handle errors better, but miss to handle the latter one properly.\n\nWe can either catch the exception or change submission to retrieve `std::expected`/`util::Result` with the error.\n\nReproducing it should also be straightforward:\n\n1) Receive an http request.\n2) sleep() during request processing, before pool submission.\n3) Trigger shutdown, sleep() after unregistering the libevent callback and interrupting the pool.\n4) Let step (2) resume.

That might be better than somewhat vauge comments about \"modern\" distros, because, (some) modern distros do already support this, and it's actually the case that all versions of all distros Bitcoin Core supports need to do this, before we could do a complete switch.\r\n\r\n",

This seems to create an incomplete wallet state representation, especially in scenarios where pruned nodes need to reconstruct historical wallet activity.\n\nWould extending support to spending transactions require additional validation logic to ensure consistency with existing UTXO tracking and wallet state management?\n\nI am currently exploring how wallet transaction metadata is handled internally, particularly how imported transactions are reconciled with the UTXO set.\n\nAny clarification on the intended architectural constraints around `importprunedfunds` would be very helpful.",

Electrum has similar behavior.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/48174c0f287b19931ca110670610bd03a03eb914/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L725-L731\r\n\r\nWhen spending an unconfirmed UTXO, it can happen that we back-date the locktime of our transaction to a locktime before the locktime of the unconfirmed parent.

      "body": "So, this paper http://ifca.ai/fc14/papers/fc14_submission_71.pdf got me thinking about the current rules for transaction rebroadcasting:\n\nOnce a transaction has been broadcast, you stop rebroadcasting. Unless you own txins or txouts in the transaction. \n\nSo, you use the paper's techniques. But you can be much more speculative than they are, and get a low-likelihood but possible IP match for an address, connect your client up, and issue a transaction paying yourself and a small amount to the address you're interested in, just over the dust amount.\n\nThe transaction should be constructed so it's unlikely to be mined.\n\nThe transaction traverses the network, then it stops being rebroadcast, _except_ by the recipient and you. If your client is connected to the wallet that owns the address, it will see rebroadcasting for some time, providing a very strong link between the two.\n\nThis seems like a bad outcome. \n\nI speculate that the 1Sochi transactions may have this motivation -- mapping addresses to determine IPs at large in Bitcoin. \n\nIt seems like the simplest thing would be to not re-re-broadcast to clients you've already spoken to, but I'll wait for smarter people than me to work out the right fix.\n",

          "body": "Thanks for opening this @marcofleon.\n\nI'd like to give a refresher and overview of Erlay, and explain some of the details of the experimentation and current approach. I also have a few questions/points that I'd like to discuss with people in the project.\n\n## Overview\n\nErlay is an alternative method of announcing transactions between peers in the Bitcoin P2P network. Erlay’s main goal is to reduce bandwidth utilization when propagating transaction data by minimizing the amount of redundant inventory messages (`INV`) exchanged between peers.\n\nIn our current transaction relaying approach (we'll be calling _txflood_ or _fanout_ from now on), every transaction is announced on every transaction relaying link in the peer-to-peer network at least once. That is, for each transaction relaying connection in the network, each side of the connection will either send or receive an `INV` message containing the given transaction. Most of these announcements (`n-1/n`) are actually redundant, but it is impossible for the announcer to know until the announcement has been sent.\n\nErlay tries to solve this issue by using set reconciliation to work out the transaction differences between two nodes connected to each other instead of just announcing all transactions through all links. To do so, nodes keep a set of transactions to be reconciled (or reconciliation set) between each of their Erlay-enabled peers, and reconciliation is performed at regular intervals. Once it is time to reconcile, peers exchange _sketches_ of their reconciliation sets, which can be used to optimally compute the symmetrical difference between their reconciliation sets and, therefore, identify which transactions need to be sent by each end of the connection.\n\nErlay works optimally (sketches are smaller and sketch differences are cheaper to compute) when the differences between sets are small. This means that, even if all peers of a given node are Erlay-enabled, some transactions will still be exchanged using fanout. Finally, as we will expand on later on, fanout is more efficient and considerably faster than set reconciliation provided the receiving node does not know about the transaction being announced.\n\n## Fanout: The current approach\n\nBefore jumping into Erlay, its important to understand how fanout works in Core, so we can reason about the proposed changes and tradeoffs. \n\nTransactions are exchanged between network peers using a 3-step protocol (`INV/GETDATA/TX`). The first round-trip of this protocol (`INV/GETDATA`) can be seen as the announcement/request phase, here is where both sides of the connection are made aware of what the other side knows. The last half-round trip (`TX`) is where the actual transaction is exchanged, if necessary. Given transactions are significantly bigger than transaction ids, the `INV/GETDATA` part of the protocol is used to minimize the amount of potentially redundant information exchanged between peers. If I don't know if you know something, I'd better make sure first before dumping a lot of data on you. Hence, if the announcement receiver knows about the target transaction, we waste a minimal amount of bandwidth, and if not, we add a minimal amount of overhead to sending the transaction.\n\nTransactions are announced between peers at random intervals following a Poisson process. The expected delay between announcements depends on the type of connection: outbounds have an independent clock per connection with an expected value of **2 seconds**, whereas inbounds share a timer with an expected value of **5 seconds**. Transactions are queued to be announced until the timer goes off, and then announced using as many inventory messages as needed to clear the queue (each INV message can hold up to 50.000 entries IIRC). These timers are in place to obfuscate when a node learns about a transaction, in order to make it harder for a global network observer to pinpoint the transaction origin.\n\nWhen a node learns about a new transaction via an inventory message, it may request it back from the announcer. Announcements are requested back in order of arrival, prioritizing outbound peers. If a peer takes too long to respond to a request, we may ask the next peer and so on. Inbound peers are de-prioritized here, by giving them a **2-second** delay before requesting. This is to prevent them from stalling us (e.g., sending multiple announcements of the same transaction from different connections to delay us from learning the announced transaction).\n\nLast but not least, when a transaction is being purposely delayed (in the `to_be_announced` queue), a node will pretend not to know about it, so it won’t reply to `GETDATA` messages requesting it. This is to prevent probing.\n\n**Pros: fast (artificially slower for privacy/DoS protection purposes)**\n\n**Cons: each transaction is announced at least once per link (too redundant)**\n\n## Erlay: The second take\n\nErlay is not a drop-in replacement for fanout, but a protocol that works alongside it. This is obvious for backwards compatibility reasons: nodes are not forced to implement or adopt the change, but it’s not the only reason why. Set reconciliation is really good at fixing small differences between sets (both fast and efficient), but it becomes way less optimal when the differences in the sets to reconcile are big: sketches become big (they grow with the size of the diffs they can compute), and the diffs are expensive to compute. This is why set reconciliation works best alongside fanout, and why our approach to implement Erlay is as a hybrid between both.\n\nOnce this becomes clear, the main question to answer when implementing Erlay is: **how we partition peers between fanout and reconciliation, and how big is the split?** This is the question that has led most of the experimentation in the project and that most of the simulations have tried to answer. To answer this question, we need to understand the properties of each group:\n\n- Fanout peers are good at propagating the transaction fast, but too much use of them leads to redundant announcements\n- Reconciliation peers are good at fixing small differences between peers, but they are, **inherently, slower at propagating transactions.**\n\nThe reason why reconciliation is slower lies in how transaction announcement is implemented in Core. When a transaction is propagated using set reconciliation, we need to go over an additional 1.5 round-trips (`REQRECON/SKETCH/RECONDIFF`) to learn if the target peer knows about a certain transaction **AND THEN,** if it doesn’t, default to `INV/GETDATA/TX` to send it. Therefore, 3 round-trips in total. This may seem a bit counter intuitive, why can we not just send the transaction straightaway once we learn the peer doesn’t have it? Because another peer could have announced the transaction before us, and the target peer may already have selected them for download. \n\nIn order to answer this question, I built a discrete-time network event simulator for Bitcoin (you can find it [here](https://github.com/sr-gi/hyperion)) so I could quickly iterate over different configurations in significantly big networks. \n\n### Experimentation and findings\n\nThe initial approach was to simply answer the following question: how small can we keep fanout so that network latency remains similar while maximizing the bandwidth savings of set reconciliation? This proved tricky right out of the bat: set reconciliation is much slower than I originally imagined, and deciding what’s acceptable in terms of latency is hard to assess. As a matter of example, here are some simulation results with no optimizations:\n\n**Network:** 110K nodes (100K unreachable, 10K reachable), random topology, 8 outbounds.\n\n| No optimizations  | Full recon | Erlay 1 (out), 10%(ins) | Full fanout |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| T-90%  | 25.07007s  | 20.413506s | 8.676374s | \n| T-100%  |32.31443s  | 27.577503s | 14.88974s | \ndata-volume (reachable) | 1038.9468 messages (4589.844 bytes)  | 846.8382 messages (4876.821 bytes) | 119.51961 messages (6120.7563 bytes) | \ndata-volume (unreachable) | 87.36723 messages (405.09848 bytes) | 71.30196 messages (429.1808 bytes) | 10.086697 messages (524.5129 bytes)  | \n\nThis shows the difference between doing full reconciliation (no fanout involved), doing minimal reconciliation (using similar parameters defined as “best” in the previous [Erlay attempt](https://github.com/naumenkogs/txrelaysim/issues/7#issuecomment-902165806), and full fanout (the current state of things). It becomes pretty clear that the impact on latency is more than significant when no optimizations are being applied, but it also raises the question: **What is acceptable in terms of latency and at what cost?**\n\nOne of the first attempts to reduce latency while maximizing our bandwidth savings was to reduce the previously mentioned expected values for the peer-announcement Poisson process sampling. Halving those artificially reduces latency with almost no effect on bandwidth (if any). This was the approach in the original [Erlay implementation](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bitcoin/blob/89de0f71dce11e29c4c115a3021e97da62ba3ce6/src/net_processing.cpp#L155-L162), but I never felt too comfortable with it. **There is little documentation (if any) of why the broadcast intervals were picked as {5s, 2s}, and if that’s the route we want to take, I think it comes from a well-reasoned discussion.**\n\n### Fine-tuning the approach\n\nThere have been several experiments and theories being tested to try to optimize the aforementioned approach to make it more latency-efficient while preserving the bandwidth savings. For an extended and more detailed explanation of some of these, I’d recommend checking the series I wrote on [Delving](https://delvingbitcoin.org/tag/erlay). Here, I’ll be highlighting the two optimizations that have shown to work in simulation.\n\n### Reconcile on trickle\n\nOne of the main reasons why Erlay is slow has to do with when data is made available to our peers. As we’ve mentioned earlier, this happens when we trickle for them (their timer has gone off, so we will try to send them whatever we have available). However, adding reconciliation on top of this means that now both need to synchronize; otherwise, if data is being purposely delayed for a peer when they request reconciliation, they will have to wait until the next reconciliation cycle to get it (FYI, this is once every 8 seconds per outbound peer at the moment). \n\nA solution for this problem is not to reply to reconciliation requests straightaway. Instead, the request can be recorded, and replied to when we trickle for that peer, ensuring that they get all transactions we have received up to that point. Here are the simulation results using the same network as before, but applying this optimization:\n\n| Recon on trickle  | Full recon | Erlay 1 (out), 10%(ins) | Full fanout |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| T-90%  | 22.339193s  | 16.797455s | 8.654676s | \n| T-100%  | 29.805967s | 23.903776s | 14.878592s | \ndata-volume (reachable) | 713.03534 messages (4071.1865 bytes)  | 562.6937 messages (4548.8276 bytes)  | 119.527855 messages (6121.74 bytes) | \ndata-volume (unreachable) |  59.583134 messages (350.2714 bytes) | 47.12237 messages (395.96457 bytes)  | 10.085797 messages (524.41187 bytes) | \n\n### INV-based fanout\n\nThe second optimization worth mentioning has to do with how we pick nodes for fanout and reconciliation. So far, nodes have been picked as a static split. We select some for reconciliation and some for fanout, making the latter big enough so a big chunk of the network can be reached fast, but not big enough so it starts being redundant, and leave the rest to reconciliation. The specific numbers here come from simulating different partitions and seeing what seems to perform better in random networks.\n\nHowever, we can do better than this. In an ideal world, if we knew how long the transaction has been propagating and what fraction of the network it has reached, we could use that to turn our fanout/reconciliation up or down. Unfortunately, we don’t have that information, but we know one thing: fanout is faster than reconciliation, therefore if we receive a transaction via fanout, we are likely to be amongst the first peers to receive it, whereas if we receive it via reconciliation, it is likely that we are further down the line.\n\nWe can use this to tweak our fanout rates:\n\n- When receiving a transaction via fanout, keep fanning out until we reach a certain threshold, and reconcile with the rest of your peers\n- If a transaction is received via reconciliation, see it as being late and keep reconciling with the rest of your peers\n\nThis approach applies to outbound connections only, given that anything learnt from an inbound connection is easy to fake, so it’s better not to be trusted. Applying this optimization on top of the previous one, and simulating for the same network, we obtain:\n\n| on-trickle + inv-based-fanout  | Full recon | Erlay 1 (out), 10%(ins) | Full fanout |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| T-90%  | 21.70218s | 14.427859s | 8.654676s | \n| T-100%  | 28.977697s  | 21.619083s | 14.878592s | \ndata-volume (reachable) | 695.2272 messages (4085.9502 bytes)   | 493.16547 messages (4593.411 bytes) | 119.527855 messages (6121.74 bytes) | \ndata-volume (unreachable) | 58.117065 messages (349.74905 bytes) | 41.418915 messages (401.29572 bytes) | 10.085797 messages (524.41187 bytes) | \n\n### Conclusions and questions\n\nWith the two presented optimizations, we are able to achieve savings of ~25% in bandwidth for the cost of ~ 67% more latency. Some of these combinations have also been tested on smaller networks with actual Bitcoin nodes implementing Erlay (using Warnet) and the obtained results have been similar. However, things are far harder (and more expensive) to test like that. \n\nI personally think the design space for improvements and optimizations may still be substantial. However, I also think I’d be good to define what is acceptable in terms of bandwidth and latency tradeoffs, and what things are open to change:\n\n- Are the expected values for the poisson processes set to stone? Is it OK to reduce them? How can we reason about the implications?\n- What are acceptable transaction propagation times? Are we OK with increasing them at all? If so, by how much?\n- What would be acceptable bandwidth savings given the additional complexity brought by this change?\n\nI’ve tried to give as much context and information as possible while keeping this digestible. I’m happy to extend on any of the directions others are curious about, explain things that may have fallen of and provide additional data.",

I'll get back to the number later.\n\nWe could add 8 more outbound **extra full connections**. But that also means simultaneously increasing the number of (default) permitted inbound connections for listening peers (say from 125 to 250), to not make the network run out of connection slots or making it easy for an attacker with tons of inbound slots to grab a large share of them. Unfortunately, with the current transaction relay design, *every* transaction INV announcement (36 bytes) goes over *every* connection at least once (and sometimes twice), so it scales with $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{txrate} \\times \\mathrm{peers})$. The more tx-carrying connections a node has (including inbound), the larger the percentage of their bandwidth is taken by INVs. And this is in a way accomplishing too much, because in addition to better partition resistance, it'll also reduce the tail latency for transactions to reach nodes in the network - something that isn't actually desired.\n\nIt's possible instead just add 8 extra **block-only connections**. These obviously do not cause a bandwidth increase due to INVs, and additionally impose less memory and CPU usage on the node. However, they also only improve block-relay partition resistance. This means that an eclipse attack on just the tx-carrying connections might be successful still, which would result in bad transaction propagation, potentially bad block reconstruction/propagation if severe, and in extreme cases, transaction censorship.\n\nWhat if there was something in between the two, that has a lower bandwidth impact than full connections, improves tx-partition-resistance unlike block-only connections, but didn't care about improving tail latency? As a thought experiment, add 8 extra **reconciliation-connections**. These are not full Erlay as proposed; they're an entirely separate connection class, and exclusively use reconciliation for transaction relay on a slower time schedule than normal transaction propagation (+ normal block/addr relay). These connections should have very low bandwidth usage in non-adversarial settings because the large majority of transaction relay is done by the normal full connections, and reconciliation bandwidth scales with the amount of transactions being reconciled. They don't worse propagation latency at all, because these 8 connections are just added on top of the existing 8 full ones. However, in adversarial settings, rather than transactions not propagating at all, they cause reconciliation to take over when normal relay fails. This will happen at the cost of extra latency as it's a second-stage fallback mechanism, but it's better than not propagating at all.\n\nSo where we are at this point is that reconciliation-based connections are an **alternative to (some of the) extra block-only connections** that also improves tx-partition-resistance, but without the $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm(peers))$ factor in bandwidth effect that full connections have.\n\nThe full Erlay idea is to not have these reconciliation connections be separate from the normal full outbound connections, but have both mechanisms (flooding and reconciliation) inside all the normal connections, and intelligently pick between them: use flooding when you guess a peer is unlikely to have already heard of the transaction, and use reconciliation otherwise. This is where I think the majority of the conceptual complexity of Erlay comes in, as it involves intricate relay policy decisions to make these guesses well, and it's also where most of @sr-gi's efforts have been in the past year, because it just feels that with good decisions, you should be able to do better than two entirely separate connection classes.\n\nBack to the number-of-connection question. There is no reason to assume that today, 8 connections is the right number for both tx propagation delay and tx-partition resistance. It's a limitation of the existing technology that forces both numbers to be the same. If we didn't care about partition resistance, would we consider reducing the number of outbound connections to reduce bandwidth (especially for incoming nodes with ~100 connections)? It's not unreasonable to me we might conclude that 4 connections is actually sufficient for transaction propagation purposes; this may be especially true with [BIP-153 block template sharing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1937). And if so, we could consider today replacing 4 of the normal outbound connections with Erlay (or similar) connections. It'd worsen propagation delay, but perhaps in an acceptable way, and not worsen partition resistance. Of course, I'm not suggesting actually doing that, but as a demonstration that what reconciliation offers is **untangling tx-propagation and tx-partition-resistance from connection-count decisions**.\n\nHowever, with the effort to integrate flooding and reconciliation into one, and thus considering the possibility of replacing (all) normal connections with mixed flood-reconciliation connections, we maybe lost sight of the fact that the goal is increasing partition resistance (without unnecessary bandwidth and propagation-delay improvements), rather than bandwidth reduction per se.\n\nMaybe it's worth reevaluating the need for combining the two. If we already had (say) 8 extra block-only connections, and it was proposed to replace some of those with reconciliation-based ones, I think it would look like a fairly interesting picture: a slight bandwidth increase, extra memory/CPU for the nodes that choose to participate, but we upgrade the partition-resistance offered by them from block-only to also cover transactions. And maybe the complexity of trying to integrate flooding and reconciliation isn't worth it here, as it's an improvement even without it.",

This would still require the added complexity of minisketch, the set reconciliation module, and the extra network messages, but the design would be much cleaner. For those concerned about the additional complexity, would this be an acceptable tradeoff (@marcofleon, @dergoegge, @stickies-v )?\n\n ",

Given all that, how much of the gap has already been closed, and how much does Erlay still improve the situation?\n\nIf we'd just be doing this to improve partition resistance (because increased connectivity is obviously better in that regard) while it's not clear that improvements are needed, then I'm not sure if I'd make this a priority myself. Given a project of this size, we'd need some momentum and at least a couple dedicated reviewers, otherwise we'll still be discussing this in 5 years.",

This would entail enabling more inbound slots without increasing outbound connections as much. So a listening node would be able to support more than the current ~11 fully-connected nodes and not take a meaningful bandwidth hit.\n\n> For those concerned about the additional complexity, would this be an acceptable tradeoff\n\nIf the simpler approach, which iiuc could look something like 8 full, 4 reconciliation, and 4 blocks-only, improves the tx relay network's partition resistance without significant drawbacks, then I would prefer that over Erlay. I'm interested in seeing what that implementation would look like in comparison.\n\nI'd still like to see the updated Erlay bandwidth and latency data with increased connection counts (no rush, just clarifying).

The intention is for `createwalletdescriptor` to be able to rotate keys in the future, so this sentence is no longer correct.\n\nIs the correct sentence:\n\n\"The address type must be one that the HD key does not already have a descriptor for.\"?\n\nLet's fix the help text to close this issue and move `hd_account` to a feature request.\n\nI think `createwalletdescriptors` should support creating/rotating accounts, and default to the first unimported account index per address type per HD key.\n\nThis helps restore privacy if [deadbeef/purpose'/0'/0'] xpubs were compromised by rotating to [deadbeef/purpose'/0'/1'] and allows managing segregated funds with one HD key.",

Created a blank descriptor wallet using `createwallet`.\n2. Imported a BIP44 descriptor with a non-zero account path (index 1).\n3. Verified the imported descriptor was `active: true` via `gethdkeys`.\n4. Ran `createwalletdescriptor legacy` and `createwalletdescriptor bech32m`.\n5. Checked `gethdkeys` again.\n\nActual Results: \nThe previously active descriptor (account 1) was set to `active: false`. It was replaced by a new active descriptor for account 0, which matches the reporter's findings.\n\nSupporting Logs:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"hd_account\": 1,\n    \"descriptors\": [\n      {\n        \"desc\": \"pkh(.../44h/1h/1h...)#4q2dlgt8\",\n        \"active\": false\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n",

Leave it up to the user if they want to use bitcoin.conf, a command flag, or whatnot to specify `datadir`.\n\nAt the very least some documentation of this and other quirks on flathub would save people time finding this issue or digging around in the source repo.\n\nIt is odd to me that the GUI doesn't allow changing the `datadir` in its settings, that would make this problem much simpler.",
