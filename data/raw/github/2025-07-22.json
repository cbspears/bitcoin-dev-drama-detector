      "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new functional test `test_psbt_incomplete_needs_additional_signature` to verify wallet behavior when a PSBT requires additional signatures and cannot be completed.\r\n\r\n## What's Added\r\n- Test scenario: Creates a 2-of-3 multisig transaction with only 1 signature provided\r\n- Behavior validation: Confirms the wallet correctly identifies the transaction as incomplete and refuses to finalize\r\n\r\nThis test ensures that Bitcoin Core's wallet properly handles the common scenario where a multisig transaction needs additional signatures before it can be broadcast to the network.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n- Previously closed PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33025\r\n\r\nOriginal request mentioned in: \r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31622\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31622#discussion_r1938366105\r\n",
