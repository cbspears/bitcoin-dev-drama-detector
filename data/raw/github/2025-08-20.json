With this PR, it will be changed to `127.0.0.1:8333` (though one line in logs shows which address is used as target). \r\n\r\n\r\nOne option would be to keep using sets for deduplication, while still preserving the historical “first specified wins” rule when selecting `onion_service_target`. That way dedup works as intended without changing existing semantics, and it matches operator expectations (since users may typically think in terms of argument order, not `CService`’s comparator). On the other hand, one could argue that relying on argument order is fragile, and that making the selection order-independent is preferable. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Notably, `hash_or_height` in `getblockstats` and `gettxoutsetinfo` do this, and results in a more cumbersome command of `bitcoin-cli getblockstats '\"<hash>\"'`. Otherwise, using a normal invocation of `bitcoin-cli getblockstats <hash>` results in `error: Error parsing JSON`. This PR marks those particular options as also being a string so that when `bitcoin-cli` fails to parse the argument as JSON, it will assume that the argument is a string and pass it straight through.",

I think the problem is caused by an implementation quirk of [`_wexecvp`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/execvp-wexecvp) or a problem with state of stdout/stderr handles before making that call, and I've been trying to use the PR to debug by adding debug commits.

After rebasing this PR branch and doing `cmake --build build --target translate`, I uploaded the resulting modified `bitcoin_en.xlf` file. This resulted in 122 (~10% of strings) being marked untranslated again in both languages. We can assume that that behavior will appear across all languages, so that means ~10% of all translated strings would need to be retranslated. That's the crux of the problem. Now, Transifex does provide suggestions based on previous translations so those translations can be filled in with the click of a button. But that means someone needs to do that for every single language. I think this issue is why we institute a translation strings freeze.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think there is a workaround to this issue. Ultimately the reason transifex thinks 121 additional strings need to be translated is because the `.xlf` files contain an id for each string which is based upon the position of a string in the `bitcoin_en.ts` file which is automatically generated from the source code using `lupdate`. But if we instead modify `bitcoin_en.ts` directly as well, `lupdate` will not change the string order so the generated `bitcoin_en.xlf` file will contain just the changed string (and some other autogenerated context changes that don't seem to make a difference), which can be uploaded to Transifex. The result is that only this single string needs to be translated and no other strings will be affected.\r\n\r\nIf this doc change is desired by contributors, and the 9 acks suggested that it is, then I think this workaround of modifying `bitcoin_en.ts` would be suitable.",

Line numbers will change whenever some previous function in the file gets a non-trivial edit... Would it be better to add `-locations none` to the LCONVERT invocation in translate.cmake?

After rebasing this PR branch and doing `cmake --build build --target translate`, I uploaded the resulting modified `bitcoin_en.xlf` file. This resulted in 122 (~10% of strings) being marked untranslated again in both languages. We can assume that that behavior will appear across all languages, so that means ~10% of all translated strings would need to be retranslated. That's the crux of the problem. Now, Transifex does provide suggestions based on previous translations so those translations can be filled in with the click of a button. But that means someone needs to do that for every single language. I think this issue is why we institute a translation strings freeze.\r\n\r\nWas \"Translation Memory Fillup\" enabled then?",

          "body": "The bpftrace script `connectblock_benchmark.bt` works. It is similar but reads a block hash instead of a txid. However, not the difference between the arg0 of `block_connected` (`8@-2432(%rbp`) and e.g. arg0 of `utxocache::add` (`8@%r15`). Maybe that's the cause for the `reg type unsupported for arg#0` error.\n\n\n```\n$ readelf -n bitcoind\n...\n  stapsdt              0x0000007a\tNT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\n    Provider: validation\n    Name: block_connected\n    Location: 0x00000000004b394e, Base: 0x0000000000a53698, Semaphore: 0x0000000000b5d6d0\n    Arguments: 8@-2432(%rbp) -4@24(%r12) 8@%rbx -4@-2360(%rbp) -8@-2320(%rbp) -8@%rax\n  stapsdt              0x00000055\tNT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\n    Provider: utxocache\n    Name: uncache\n    Location: 0x00000000005a8ca3, Base: 0x0000000000a53698, Semaphore: 0x0000000000b5d6d2\n    Arguments: 8@%rbx 4@32(%rbx) 4@%eax -8@72(%rsi) 1@%dl\n  stapsdt              0x00000051\tNT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\n    Provider: utxocache\n    Name: add\n    Location: 0x00000000005a9204, Base: 0x0000000000a53698, Semaphore: 0x0000000000b5d6d6\n    Arguments: 8@%r15 4@32(%r15) 4@%eax -8@72(%r14) 1@%dl\n  stapsdt              0x00000053\tNT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\n    Provider: utxocache\n    Name: spent\n    Location: 0x00000000005ab673, Base: 0x0000000000a53698, Semaphore: 0x0000000000b5d6d4\n    Arguments: 8@%r13 4@32(%r13) 4@%eax -8@72(%rbx) 1@%dl\n```\n",
