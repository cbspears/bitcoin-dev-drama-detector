      "body": "From what I deciphered reading the line https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/macdeploy/macdeployqtplus#L390 is that qt translations are optional to have hence we should be able to build without it but the case where the flag translations_dir falls back to its default Null value it raises this error. \r\nI have moved the code which adds language files under the if statement that first checks if the value of the flag is not Null before referencing it.\r\nThis PR assumes that having Qt translations is optional however this statement requires a second opinion.\r\nBuild completes successfully post this change with default value of the flag.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"754\" height=\"372\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-10 at 9 11 25 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61b74a88-465b-4719-b8f4-dcf165c6ad79\" />\r\n",
