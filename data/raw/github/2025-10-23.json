I think that reverting the defaults now would be a bad idea. And even if, the path to do this should not be this PR and changing defaults should not be bundled with introducing a new knob.\r\n\r\n@cedwies, this new PR keeps v30 defaults AND also removes the \"public knob\". It must definitely keep the new count default constant, as that is the main new concept introduced. Specifically for:\r\n\r\n1. Custom client's policy, including ones that wish full pre-v30 policy compatibility\r\n2. More exhaustive testing\r\n3. Consistency and specificity\r\n\r\n@achow101, this new PR should not be \"re-litigating\" anything, but if there is, I'll be glad to discover how.\r\n\r\nConstructive feedback is welcomed.",

      "body": "This has been a recent discovery; the general thread pool class created for #26966, cleanly \r\nintegrates into the HTTP server. It simplifies init, shutdown and requests execution logic.\r\nReplacing code that was never unit tested for code that is properly unit and fuzz tested.\r\nAlthough our functional test framework extensively uses this RPC interface (that’s how\r\nwe’ve been ensuring its correct behavior so far - which is not the best).\r\n\r\nThis clearly separates the responsibilities:\r\nThe HTTP server now focuses solely on receiving and dispatching requests, while ThreadPool handles\r\nconcurrency, queuing, and execution.\r\n\r\nThis will also allows us to experiment with further performance improvements at the task queuing and\r\nexecution level, such as a lock-free structure or task prioritization or any other implementation detail\r\nlike coroutines in the future, without having to deal with HTTP code that lives on a different layer.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThe rationale behind introducing the ThreadPool first is to be able to easily cherry-pick it across different\r\nworking paths. Some of the ones that are benefited from it are #26966 for the parallelization of the indexes\r\ninitial sync, #31132 for the parallelization of the inputs fetching procedure, #32061 for the libevent replacement,\r\nthe kernel API #30595 (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30595#discussion_r2413702370) to avoid blocking validation among others use cases not publicly available.\r\n\r\nNote 2:\r\nI could have created a wrapper around the existing code and replaced the `WorkQueue` in a subsequent\r\ncommit, but it didn’t seem worth the extra commits and review effort. The `ThreadPool` implements\r\nessentially the same functionality in a more modern and cleaner way.",

It's usually where we all start.\r\nGenerally, the project consensus is to avoid introducing new external dependencies (unless they’re maintained by us) to minimize potential attack vectors. This doesn’t mean we should reinvent everything, just that we need to be very careful about what we decide to include.\r\n\r\nThat being said, for the changes introduced in this PR, can argue that we’re encapsulating, documenting, and unit + fuzz testing code that wasn’t covered before, while also improving separation of responsibilities. We’re not adding anything more complex or that behaves radically differently from what we currently have.\r\nThe nice property of this PR is that it will let us experiment with more complex approaches in the future without having to deal with application-specific code (like the HTTP server code).

Switching to notify_all() only forces all workers awake on every submission, which masks the OS scheduler starvation you get in this kind of extreme setup.\r\n\r\nI've been playing with the fuzz test and found that this fixes it for me:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nThreadPool g_pool{\"fuzz\"};\r\nsize_t g_num_workers = 3;\r\nstd::atomic<bool> g_pool_started{false};\r\n\r\nstatic void setup_threadpool_test()\r\n{\r\n    LogInstance().DisableLogging();\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nFUZZ_TARGET(threadpool, .init = setup_threadpool_test)\r\n{\r\n    if (!g_pool_started.exchange(true)) {\r\n        g_pool.Start(g_num_workers);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data_provider(buffer.data(), buffer.size());\r\n ```\r\n \r\n Oversubscribed by a lot and left it running for a long time with `-timeout=10` and it's good to go, no timeouts. This is with `notify_one` as well.\r\n \r\nThere's two changes here. The first is to start the thread pool inside of the first iteration. This fixes a problem I was having with the [LibAFL](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL/tree/main/crates/libafl_libfuzzer) version of libfuzzer. It would hang immediately because LibAFL calls `fork()` after calling the init function, and so the child processes would end up only having one thread active (the main calling thread) and no workers.\r\n\r\nThe second change is just switching from `call_once` to a global that we check every iteration. This fixes the original non-reproducible timeout issue I had with libFuzzer. I don't really know why, but I'm guessing `call_once` is more complicated than the simpler check.\r\n \r\nOverall, I've learned that multi core fuzzing and multiple threads in a fuzz test don't mix well it seems. It leads to issues that are hard to reproduce and debug. For the purposes of testing the threadpool under heavy load, I think it's fine to use work arounds like this to get it done.",

          "body": "It looks like reusing compact block messages doesn't make sense -- including two blocks' worth of data seems pretty useful, but that could result in an ~8MB `blocktxns` data if your mempool was empty and the top of the mempool was full of inscriptions, which would in turn [exceed the 4MB maximum message size we have](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33191#pullrequestreview-3383627846). We could expand the maximum message size, but large messages can be a DoS vector, so splitting the template response up probably makes more sense. That also provides the opportunity to describe the block template more directly, rather than pretending it's a block with a header committing to the txids and perhaps a coinbase committing to the wtxids. So current work is on redesigning the p2p messages and making template reconstruction an iterative thing (\"here's the first batch of missing transactions\", ..., \"here's the next batch of missing transactions\") rather than a one shot (\"here's all the missing transactions, you now have a template!\")",

      "body": "`Bitcoin Core 30.0`\n\nI automatically measure the verification time between \"Saw new header\" or \"Saw new cmpctblock header\" and \"UpdateTip:\" for the same height in debug.log. Almost always that time difference is 0 or 1 second. However, at block 920139 I see a huge spike of 443 seconds. Turns out there is something strange happening for block 920138. Here's what debug.log reports for this block:\n\n```\n2025-10-21T17:17:37Z Saw new cmpctblock header hash=00000000000000000000a0eb867d25dd2e5284750888c545607d30aecc48c691 height=920138 peer=96259\n2025-10-21T17:17:37Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000000a0eb867d25dd2e5284750888c545607d30aecc48c691 height=920138 version=0x28000000 log2_work=95.892695 tx=1259718316 date='2025-10-21T17:17:24Z' progress=1.000000 cache=276.8MiB(2069960txo)\n2025-10-21T17:17:37Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000002e852c1cb8e698df53a4c2646115fbb73d78298b5b2c height=920138 peer=92507\n2025-10-21T17:27:00Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000002e852c1cb8e698df53a4c2646115fbb73d78298b5b2c height=920138 version=0x3227a000 log2_work=95.892695 tx=1259718525 date='2025-10-21T17:17:07Z' progress=0.999995 cache=276.8MiB(2071109txo)\n```\n\nSo there's a \"Saw new cmpctblock header\" and almost immediately the UpdateTip as usual. However, at the same time a \"Saw new header\" comes in for that same height and now the verification takes almost 10 minutes and progress falls from 1.000000 to 0.999995. This looks to me like a double verification for the same height where the second verification takes much longer.  Maybe it has something to do with a reorg, maybe this is normal behavior but I wanted to report it here just to be sure.\n\nBelow what happens around height 920138 in debug.log:\n\n```\n2025-10-21T16:59:13Z Saw new cmpctblock header hash=00000000000000000000f640d1940946015764ddcc37a631d8aebe69301a79d2 height=920135 peer=99563\n2025-10-21T16:59:13Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000000f640d1940946015764ddcc37a631d8aebe69301a79d2 height=920135 version=0x20052000 log2_work=95.892658 tx=1259707764 date='2025-10-21T16:58:20Z' progress=1.000000 cache=276.8MiB(2053530txo)\n2025-10-21T17:00:56Z New block-relay-only v2 peer connected: version: 70016, blocks=920135, peer=160571\n2025-10-21T17:01:43Z Saw new header hash=00000000000000000001317b451e3306a1b62bb0ceb1b81524f90f95c6c95186 height=920136 peer=15656\n2025-10-21T17:01:44Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000001317b451e3306a1b62bb0ceb1b81524f90f95c6c95186 height=920136 version=0x206b6000 log2_work=95.892671 tx=1259710624 date='2025-10-21T17:00:47Z' progress=1.000000 cache=276.8MiB(2057507txo)\n2025-10-21T17:06:52Z New block-relay-only v2 peer connected: version: 70016, blocks=920136, peer=160814\n2025-10-21T17:12:36Z New block-relay-only v2 peer connected: version: 70016, blocks=920136, peer=161247\n2025-10-21T17:14:46Z [net:info] portmap: Added mapping pcp:95.99.132.155:8333 -> 192.168.1.20:8333 (for 2400s)\n2025-10-21T17:14:46Z AddLocal(95.99.132.155:8333,3)\n2025-10-21T17:15:13Z Saw new cmpctblock header hash=000000000000000000004f08e2501645727550d7474400a3fa0ff7013dcd4ea9 height=920137 peer=21\n2025-10-21T17:15:13Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000004f08e2501645727550d7474400a3fa0ff7013dcd4ea9 height=920137 version=0x200de000 log2_work=95.892683 tx=1259713766 date='2025-10-21T17:14:48Z' progress=1.000000 cache=276.8MiB(2065321txo)\n2025-10-21T17:17:37Z Saw new cmpctblock header hash=00000000000000000000a0eb867d25dd2e5284750888c545607d30aecc48c691 height=920138 peer=96259\n2025-10-21T17:17:37Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000000a0eb867d25dd2e5284750888c545607d30aecc48c691 height=920138 version=0x28000000 log2_work=95.892695 tx=1259718316 date='2025-10-21T17:17:24Z' progress=1.000000 cache=276.8MiB(2069960txo)\n2025-10-21T17:17:37Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000002e852c1cb8e698df53a4c2646115fbb73d78298b5b2c height=920138 peer=92507\n2025-10-21T17:19:37Z Saw new header hash=0000000000000000000004f6eb492f1e998b569a1940f690d0b691a2f4ba2d00 height=920139 peer=27652\n2025-10-21T17:25:54Z Saw new header hash=00000000000000000000c183ce29bb73ddf8e00419ce437bfc58f0abd8d1b161 height=920140 peer=27652\n2025-10-21T17:27:00Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000004f08e2501645727550d7474400a3fa0ff7013dcd4ea9 height=920137 version=0x200de000 log2_work=95.892683 tx=1259713766 date='2025-10-21T17:14:48Z' progress=0.999992 cache=276.8MiB(2066586txo)\n2025-10-21T17:27:00Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000002e852c1cb8e698df53a4c2646115fbb73d78298b5b2c height=920138 version=0x3227a000 log2_work=95.892695 tx=1259718525 date='2025-10-21T17:17:07Z' progress=0.999995 cache=276.8MiB(2071109txo)\n2025-10-21T17:27:00Z UpdateTip: new best=0000000000000000000004f6eb492f1e998b569a1940f690d0b691a2f4ba2d00 height=920139 version=0x202e2000 log2_work=95.892708 tx=1259722731 date='2025-10-21T17:19:29Z' progress=0.999997 cache=277.3MiB(2074876txo)\n2025-10-21T17:27:01Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000000c183ce29bb73ddf8e00419ce437bfc58f0abd8d1b161 height=920140 version=0x2c542000 log2_work=95.892720 tx=1259726559 date='2025-10-21T17:25:32Z' progress=1.000000 cache=277.8MiB(2079466txo)\n2025-10-21T17:27:01Z txindex is catching up on block notifications\n2025-10-21T17:27:01Z txindex is catching up on block notifications\n2025-10-21T17:28:03Z Flushed fee estimates to fee_estimates.dat.\n2025-10-21T17:32:07Z Saw new header hash=0000000000000000000005d578e2ed197675684b0e9d57e19081b18879179804 height=920141 peer=105484\n2025-10-21T17:32:08Z UpdateTip: new best=0000000000000000000005d578e2ed197675684b0e9d57e19081b18879179804 height=920141 version=0x26000000 log2_work=95.892732 tx=1259730043 date='2025-10-21T17:31:56Z' progress=1.000000 cache=277.8MiB(2037404txo)\n```",

cache (correctly) skip the `save cache` step:\n  - hit: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/actions/runs/19432180632/job/55593622499\n  - hit: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/actions/runs/19446225902/job/55641312057\n- Cache is evicted for some reason, presumably due to low space\n- Next Merge run cache-misses, does a slow rebuild, and saves a new cache:\n  - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/actions/runs/19451599232/job/55657255541\n\nIf it's a while between the cache eviction and the next merge, we will see all intermediate PR jobs take a long time to run, as there is no cache for them to hit on until the next merge.\n\nNot sure there is any fix for this, other than using a 3rd party cache (like S3), increasing our GH cache allowance (heard rumours this may come, but probably only for Enterprise I'd guess) or move these jobs to hosted runners which have better caching. The only provider I had in mind here would be Warp, but they say their cache [doesn't work on Windows machines](https://docs.warpbuild.com/ci/cache).\n\nNo good options from me still.",

For example, right now I see `win64-native-vcpkg-binary-04fcf06a88f8571c75c5068ea9f67b8012e86d99ba204a334c696f0ec5e79551 2.6 GB cached 5 hours ago\n[29.x](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/29.x)\nLast used 5 hours ago`. I don't think there is any value in saving caches for non-main branches, as there won't be any pull requests that could use them within the one-week cache duration limit (except for some rare backport pulls).\n\nSo the fix would be to to only write the cache on the default branch?",
