      "body": "We currently fail migration if the wallet does not contain the best block locator.\r\nThis is a problem for wallets created before https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/152, which are not storing such record.\r\n\r\nMissing this record is not an error. it simply means the wallet will scan the chain prior\r\nto finish migration.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nOriginally I wrote the test using a BDB library (`bsddb3`) but I wasn't happy with the\r\nnew dependency, and ended up zeroing the record length manually. I'm not sure this\r\nwill work on every platform. If it doesn't, we can just just drop the test as this can be\r\ntested manually on any ancient wallet too.",

      "body": "This PR deprecates the \"startingheight\" result field of the `getpeerinfo` RPC, following the discussion in #33990.\r\n\r\nRationale: the reported starting height of a peer in the VERSION message is untrusted, and it doesn't seem to be useful anymore (after #20624), so deprecating the corresponding field seems reasonable. After that, it can be removed, along with the `m_starting_height` field of the Peer / CNodeStats structs, as it is sufficient to show the reported height only once at connection in the debug log.",
